[This is how I would present my work in a talk. I'm imagining the people I mention to be sitting in the audience. Which is quite possible.]

[Oh god, what if Jason Orne is doing the same thing. I need to play to my strengths, namely that I'm probably better equipped to do the computational and quant work. He was super friendly about it, though.]

In the future, I should start by saying what this project is not.

- It is not a macro-level take on what urban change is, or where same-sex couples are in metro areas, or how that's changed. Mike Bader has done this. Amy Spring has done this.
- It is not a micro-level take on the stories of individual gay/LGBTQ/queer neighborhoods, whether their recent history or their distant past. Amin Ghaziani has done this. Christina Hanhardt has done this.

It is, instead, a meso-level take. I'm directly inspired by some of the questions that Ghaziani leaves open. I'm attempting to response to the call put out by Amy Stone to move beyond NYC and SF.

Methodologically, some of what I'm doing might seem innovative, but it's also a retro throwback, to methods used by Martin Levine and Manuel Castells. Other particularly inspiring works Hayslett and Kane, Doan et al, and the Dallas one. What these have in common is that they focus on cities outside the core of the queer urban imaginary.

Let's talk terminology.

{gay, LGBTQ, queer} neighborhoods

what about {neighborhood, enclave, village, ghetto}?

fn: Brown 2014 contains an excellent summary of the different terms that have been used in the academic literature.

There's no neutral terminology. But I have to use words to talk about my object. I like neighborhood because it contains fewer assumptions about social dynamics (as with ghetto or village) but it does contain the connotation that I care about: that this space is a *meaningful cultural object*.

The sources I use are likely to bias my project toward (cis, white) gay men. But that is to be shown rather than assumed. Unlike Levine and Castells, I see no reason to exclude women *a priori*. Instead, we can look at *the extent to which* these spaces are *empirically* biased toward men. (We've got theory [Hanhardt] that shows us who is privileged by visibility. And public institutions that I can verify the existences of are by definition visible.)

Let's talk about categories and classification.

- we've got some criteria. Four, specifically.
- prototypes and deviations. ideal types. continuums. that's how categories work.
- prototypes do not have to be *representative*, either. The median gay neighborhood doesn't look like Greenwich Village or the Castro.
- I'm using one of these criteria, because it's something I can measure, and it's relatively common, even universal.
- I am making pragmatic choices, not definitive ones.

Let's talk about gay bars.

- This is not about gay bars. If you want to know about gay bars, talk to Greggor Mattson.
- This is about gay neighborhoods.
- Clusters of gay bars are a reasonable proxy for gay neighborhoods.
- Since I don't care about the bars for themselves, I don't have to find the entire population of bars. I'm not too concerned about bias and selectivity, unless you think gay bars in gay neighborhoods are *less* likely to be in my data than gay bars elsewhere. You don't think that.
- In fact, I am going to do the opposite of what you would expect---throw out a lot of the bars in my data. I don't care about isolated gay bars, only about gay bars in gay neighborhoods.

Let's talk about neighborhoods

- A Census tract is not a neighborhood.
- Neighborhood boundaries could be sharp, or they could be fuzzy. They could be official, or informal. They could be universally accepted, or contested.
- My project needs boundaries. I'll be using them pragmatically. I do not claim that these boundaries are definitive. In fact, I can show you cases where insider knowledge might dispute the exact boundaries my rules and algorithms come up with.
- [Can I validate based on whether these clusters correspond to neighborhoods in the GayCities data? That's not a bad idea, and makes the clustering into a "finding". Part of the problem is that bars in the same tract can have different labels or one can be missing a label, but it's okay that the validation labels are noisy, really...]
- [Michele's point: quant people know that Census tracts aren't good proxies, they just don't have a better alternative. In this case, I do have a better alternative: aggregations of Census tracts based on locations of anchor institutions.]

Let's talk about change

- Sociodemographic or economic change is only one kind of change we might see or care about.
- It isn't going to tell us anything about cultural or institutional change, on the ground or on the streets or in the bars.
- "No change" might be misleading, even on a demographic level. It might be happening on a different time scale than we can see in this data, or it might not have happened yet.
- Still, do we really think we'd see dramatic upheavals the everyday life of gay spaces without seeing sociodemographic shifts as well?

Let's talk about other proxies

- Same-sex couples. No. People do this (Gates and Ost), but it has all of the same problems as my method (Brown and Knopp). If you think this is better, you really don't appreciate the magnitude of measurement error in the ACS.
- Archival, historical, qualitative, academic literature. I've done this. It generally corresponds. Downside is, it only words for cities that have already been studied. Plus, the time periods are heterogeneous.
- Just asking people. Great, I'll need research funding and a time machine. Also, this is basically what a crowdsourced list of gay bars does, indirectly.

Why am I not doing {X, a totally different project}?

- for some X: because other people are doing it
- for other X: because it's not as interesting as you think it is

I just think it's simpler than people make it out to be: the qual folks are right, constructs are fuzzy, deal with it and move on. you're not gonna get a true/logical/accurate definition of a gay neighborhood that works universally and is empirically feasible to use, so be pragmatic about it

Let's talk about data sources

- We trust convention and authority too much.
- I want to call this into question: We know that for studying LGBTQ people, data from the Census have huge shortcomings. For same-sex couples, error rates are incredibly high, in a way that particularly hinders cross-temporal comparisons.
- I'm taking advantage of the Census's strengths by looking at the center rather than the margins, at more normative categories: different-sex married couples, white people, etc.
- I trust random gay people on the internet more than I trust a lot of data sources.
- There's this meme that you have to have done everything you possibly could in order to validate your choices. That's not true. For this project, it's always going to be possible to think of one more thing I could have done. Why not look at same-sex couples? Or gay community centers? Or interview people? What I'm arguing for is pragmatism, for "good enough." You're welcome to not find that satisfactory, but then I'd point you to other moves that you accept without question.

# workshop

Part of why workshopping in Contexts is exhausting and makes me defensive, is that straight people seem to have a harder time than queer folks accepting that there is almost always a clear answer to the questions: "does this city have a gay neighborhood? where is the gay neighborhood?" Any queer person with reasonable community knowledge can give you an answer. Finding gay neighborhoods is not hard. What I'm doing is not radical or impossible. (People have literally been doing it in academic work since the 1970s.)

There is some debate over, "does *this* really count as a gay neighborhood?" What's gay enough to count? But for the most part, people know the most visibly gay part of their city, or if it doesn't really have one. I'm not saying it's 100% clear---but really, what ever is? As far as social objects go, it's pretty damn clear. Maybe I need to be more assertive on that point.

Michele: still thinks I'm doing the MA that Aimée wants me to do. I am not doing that. It's not her fault that she thinks that, but I want her not to think that. What can I do to convince her that that is not what I am doing and not what I want to do?

This is also not a bar study. I am using a cultural measurement, but then looking at demographic outcomes. I don't care about the number of bars on a year-by-year basis.

Ian: was surprised that I'm not looking only, or even primarily, at the de-gaying or straight-ification of gay neighborhoods. But that move, that *intersectional* move, is precisely the intervention, the shift, I think is important to make. That's the idea, the conversation, that got me started on this project in the first place.

Is the mechanism of change the "cool" factor? Is that something that it's even possible to control for? Or desirable to? That's an important critique I'm exposing myself too---what if this is just a change that nightlife districts experience? But measuring "cool" probably is impossible in this frame of research---especially measuring the *change* in cool. David Grazian might be helpful here...

He raises an important point: by choosing to focus on the core, not the periphery; on prototypically gay neighborhoods, I'm making my project about white gay men. But I still want an answer to the question: how white, how gay, how male? That's answerable if we just look at the numbers, and that's descriptive table one of my paper.

I say gay way more often when talking about this project than when talking about anything else (and for queer folks who aren't gay, like Ian and Hannah, that's a problem. Or I feel like it is for them.) But there are so many moving parts, so many things that are contestable, and so many things that are confusing to straight people, that using "gay" as a fixed point really does help me.

Part of the intervention I'm making is to give fewer fucks about NYC. I don't care if it's a huge outlier---I even expect it to be a huge outlier. Same with San Francisco. But I care more about Atlanta, Dallas, San Diego, Denver, Seattle... Mid-sized cities, regional centers. The ones that geographically-oriented LGBTQ scholarship has neglected. (Is this in conflict with my other claim: that I want prototypically gay neighborhoods? Aren't the Castro and Greenwich Village the most prototypical of all?)

Lee: Lee's instincts are the opposite of mine. He wants to start general and theoretical: let's characterize change in cities and neighborhoods! And then move down to specific cases. My question is, hasn't this been done? His sense is no, not really. (But, as Tim confirmed, Mike Bader is a thing.) My fear is that this is a hard thing to do. He suggested using something like a LCMM, and seeing whether gay bars are associated with particular trajectories. But will that tell me if they're different from demographically similar neighborhoods? I'm still wrestling with why his approach is better.

He did think that within-city controls were better than between-city controls.

What neighborhood characteristics matter for change? Can I do a PCA using not too many variables, and get something explainable? Better characterize the types of change that exist.

Tim: confirmed my fears that it's really hard to see change over time of any sort in the ACS alone. Neighborhoods supposedly don't change on that short of a time scale. I may need to go back to the 2000 Census as t1.

He suggested using votes / policies to get at gay-friendly neighborhoods. This is *literally* one of the 5 strategies used by Castells. I'd love policy outcomes, as well.

Erin: my advisor and committee are the folks who will know what is required for an MVP MA. I should ask them. But I'm most interested in things that *logically* block my progress or might break my plans, versus things that would be nice to do, or would confirm or strengthen confidence in my results. The question is, can I proceed? Can I get results at all? Everything not related to that question goes in a bucket for later.

Hannah: am I comfortable doing the archival and interpretive work to classify things at the boundaries? I am, but I really want to know what other people are comfortable with. I'd be comfortable even just asking queer folks---for contemporary locations of gay neighborhoods. I think that's a harder problem for gay neighborhoods in the past.

Maria: do both---both matched controls, *and* gay neighborhoods vs all other neighborhoods.

Tyler: a couple times, he was like, the question I have for you is how are you going to do this thing? and my response was, I don't know, that's what I was hoping to get help with here. He did point out that Oklahoma City does have a clearly defined gay neighborhood, but it's more residential than bars. Wouldn't that be invisible according to my method? My response: Because I'm interested in more prototypically gay neighborhoods, I think I'm comfortable sacrificing places like Oklahoma City. By contrast, I think I *need* to remove places like Austin and Portland---even at the cost of losing places like Oklahoma City. But, again, multiple specifications or classifications is probably the answer.

The gay bar / gay neighborhood thing is really just the fundamental problem of categorization. Boundaries are literally always fuzzy. That is literally how the world works; how humans work. (Cognitive linguistics, Durkheim...)

But I probably need to draw a boundary somewhere between gay and not-gay in order to proceed. It doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to be there.

... unless I do a fancy confusing Bayesian thing where I just say that things that are more gay (or that I'm more sure are gay) count more. But that makes my work more complex and more muddled.

One way to do selection might be to pick only neighborhoods that are still gay now, not ones that have disappeared. These would be, by definition, "strong" gay neighborhoods.

Stew's comments:

> First though, I think that this is a really interesting project!  And, I applaud your willingness to wade into a project that requires complex measurement and analytical approaches. The question that you are posing is deceptively simple, “Are gay neighborhoods subject to (vulnerable to?) different changes than non-gay neighborhoods.”  But, as your document clearly reveals, the devil is in the details!

> You are correct to give serious consideration to how you will define “gay neighborhoods.” How convincingly you are able to do this will have a huge effect on how exposed you will be to critics and reviewers. The existence of gay bars seems to me like a reasonable center of gravity. Of course, there are two types of errors that you will need to minimize (1) classifying as “gay” neighborhoods that are not gay and (2) failing to identify truly gay neighborhoods. As you work toward your final strategy for operationalization and measurement, I recommend that you keep these two “threats” in mind and plan your strategy for deflecting critics who might claim that you are making one error, or the other.

> As I understand your proposal, you plan to aggregate up from individual- and household-level data in the ACS to obtain tract-level characteristics. Correct? One question I have is how many individuals and households will you have in the average tract in the ACS data?  And, if that number is not very big, how confident will you be (or, in other words, how much error will there by) in your tract-level measures? At least for some of your tract-level characteristics (e.g., total population, racial composition, sex composition) I think you could take advantage of 2000 and 2010 census data for tracts that are based on the 100% count. These should be available through the National Historical Geographic Information System website at the University of Minnesota. Could these be used to supplement the tract-level characteristics that cannot be obtained from the 100% count census questions?

> Finally, I understand that you are especially interested in comments on measurement and methods. However, I cannot help but be curious about the broader theoretical concerns that will motivate your study. How, for example, would the experience of the residents of gay neighborhoods be comparable to, or different from, the residents of gentrifying neighborhoods in which non-whites are displaced by whites. Is this a more general story about the vulnerabilities of disadvantaged minority populations? Is it a story that is more specific to the LGBTQ population? What specific hypotheses will guide your empirical analyses, and how are they related to a general conceptual framework?

My response:

Thank you so much! These thoughts are really helpful. I'm definitely worried about measurement error in the ACS, but my plan is to start there and then broaden to the Census data if necessary. And I'm still at work on sharpening my theoretical framing—I've been pulled in different directions as to whether this is a general or specific story, but I'm hoping that doing some empirical analysis will help steer me toward answering that question of appropriate framing.

Of the types of errors you describe in classifying neighborhoods, I'm far more worried about (1) than (2), and the reason for that is that a (residentially) gay neighborhood that LGBTQ people don't even know about is probably too "under the radar" to count for my purposes. That is, it's unlikely that a space that's that invisible would be subject to the kinds of forces I'm talking about—i.e., to experience different sorts of changes because it's gay. It could be, though, that there are specific local stories about gay places that were known locally but have gone missing or been forgotten in national sources or academic sources—but LGBTQ historians, geographers, and sociologists have put a lot of effort specifically into remedying that problem, and I think for the post-2000 time period it's been resolved as well as it's ever going to be.

Does that rationale make sense? It's a hunch I've had for a while, but I'm still working on articulating it...

Mahesh's comments:

> You’re working on something really, really interesting here, and the struggles you have align with struggles I have studying ethnic neighborhoods and retailers. I’m curious what you eventually come up with, and I’d love to stay in touch about it. I’ll share with you some things on which I’ve received pushback and that you’d likely receive pushback on to.

> First, when using non-traditional data sets on something like gay bars, it is very difficult to convince people that you have either (a) the full population of gay bars, or (b) a non-biased sample of gay bars. Is there a way to use Economic Census information to identify gay bars? I’m guessing not. That works in your favor because you can then say, “Source X is the closest thing to a full population that is available.” It would be worth thinking through what factors would bias your data set, however, so that you can discuss them.

> Second, it is really important to back off of modeling strategies at this stage and ask simpler questions about constructs. How does one operationalize a gay neighborhood? How does one operationalize neighborhood change? You have to be crystal clear on these points before you have a clear sense of what you’re modeling. If you’re relying on Census data, you’re looking at a tough task. My recommendation is to basically do a variety of robustness checks under many different operational definitions of gayborhood and neighborhood change. That’s what I do in my gentrification research.

> Third, I don’t see any theoretical motivation for your analyses? What exactly are your hypotheses? What literature generated those hypotheses, and to what literature are you looking to contribute? You focus heavily on methods at the expense of theory, at least in the materials you provided.

> In short, I would take a step back and think about the larger motivation of the project and the larger concepts I am trying to discuss. Only after that would I worry about data sets, data validity, and analytic strategies.

> I hope this makes sense. Happy to chat further. And thanks for that shout out on Twitter!

My response:

Thank you, this is really helpful.

You're right that I probably need to give a fuller account of what kinds of data exist or don't, even if I thought it was fairly obvious. Sexuality is not race, and there aren't traditional data sets to reach for.

I didn't include my literature review, because I doubted people in Contexts would be familiar with it and because it's currently a 30-page monstrosity. I need to work to get it down to a couple assertive and concise paragraphs, and integrate it with my proposal and methods memos, if only so people stop thinking I pulled the bars thing out of thin air. I do promise that there's a literature and an audience for this kind of work.

I'm less familiar with the broader literature on neighborhood change, or about how to operationalize neighborhood change (or "gentrification"). If there are standardized, legible ways of doing that, I'd be happy to read up on them and borrow them. In fact, "how does one operationalize neighborhood change?" is precisely the kind of thing I had hoped the Contexts group would have opinions and advice on.

I don't want to reinvent the wheel, or spend my entire MA worried about constructs. For my personal and professional goals, it's important for me to move on to modeling as quickly as possible, but I'm absolutely happy to try alternative specifications for robustness checks. For defining gay neighborhoods, I think that takes the form of different clustering methods, thresholds, or cutoffs; or else of differing degrees of incorporating qualitative or archival evidence as a filtering mechanism. I don't think it makes sense to incorporate other aspects of definitions of gay neighborhoods, like the locations of same-sex couples (like in Gates and Ost 2004, or Spring 2013), but if this work turns out to be absolutely unconvincing to certain audiences, I may have to do that as well.

Alternatively, the solution I may wind up adopting is, depressingly enough, just not presenting this work to those audiences...

Best,
Connor

I should ask Contexts for a list of journals that they would try to publish in, and then not try to publish in those. Or be more self-consciously sociological: okay y'all, so you've heard of the Chicago School. Or maybe I could be really macho sociologist and cite Durkheim on categories and Weber on ideal types. take off your demographer hat, put on your sociologist hat, and use what you know about how social categories work. In hindsight, I should have gone in and not said the word "gay", and just asked them to give feedback as if they were talking about any kind of neighborhood.
