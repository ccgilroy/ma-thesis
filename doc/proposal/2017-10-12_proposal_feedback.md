Notes from advisee meeting with Jenni, Lanu, Stephanie, Xinguang, Berndt

Worry about theory later; the MA is primarily an exercise in doing research. Save the existential questions for the dissertation and comps. (Is the gay neighborhood a thing? How do we measure it? could be a whole paper... that's the MA Aim√©e would love me to write, but not what I'm doing.)

The dramatic "I contend that it is possible..." paragraph is not a research question, more of a meta-point.

Make clear explicit hypotheses about what kinds of changes I expect to see. "If qualitative research is right, I expect to see this; if not, that."

Narrow time frame related to rapid change: give my rationale; maybe even cite my prior work with Kate. (see below.) I don't have to talk about or consider alternatives: assert, this is what I'm doing.

Cut out case 3 from typology of results because it's too muddled: interesting != testable hypothesis. Bracket this, deal with it if I find it, don't get ahead of myself, move it to the discussion and conclusion.

Not only does writing a smaller, more doable MA make things easier for myself, it makes the work itself less muddled. I can focus on important stuff like what specific changes I expect to see.

I can be conservative about case selection, and pick the clear cases, because I'm testing qual literature.

I need to get clearer about terms: {space, community neighborhood}. Community is the secret latent concept I really care about; neighborhood is a spatial instantiation of it.

I have this implicit assumption that change is bad; flip it: Is change bad? This is coming from the qualitative literature---"There goes the gayborhood" is an assertion that something bad is happening, so I'm looking for bad things in a new way. What about good changes, e.g. a neighborhood becoming safer over time?

What change do I expect to see and why is it bad? Be more explicit on both counts, provide more justification.

Short time scale is novel for sociologists, but makes sense here because of rapid change. Give the list of things that have changed. It's weird how this has converged with my prior work.

Undesirable consequences of positive change was intriguing to Lanu; draw out this paradox or contrast in the discussion if it is in fact borne out.

Back to case selection: Could take different approaches, e.g. select 5 cities from qual research and do a quant analysis. Looking for prominent, large, lasting gay neighborhoods. This would be as a proof of concept, putting limits rather than looking to encompass all gay neighborhoods, on cases where I can tell you this approach makes sense. Worry about less, becasue the method and data are both new.
