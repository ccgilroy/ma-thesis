# geocoding

The bars with addresses

I adjudicate the 9 addresses for which Google Maps returns multiple results manually.

Finally, the 38 addresses for which the Census returns a tie or a failure to match,

geocode using latitude and longitude provided by Google Maps

In this way, I am able to successfully geocode all 840 bars to Census tracts in the United States.

[is that methods or results?]

# clustering

regionalization also reduces the margin of error in the ACS [CITE]

adjacent tracts

(tracts that share only a corner, not a line border, are not considered adjacent)

I used the `igraph` package [CITE] to assign numeric labels to these clusters.

See [APPENDIX] for a network graph of these clusters

# filtering

rule of no downtowns

*A city's central business district is not its gay neighborhood.*

This is an operationalization of Levine's third criterion for gay neighborhoods

ones and zeros.


See [APPENDIX] for these labels. (Or present them in main body of text?)

one approach is qualitative and inductive

the other is quantitative
