# Introduction

Are gay neighborhoods changing because they are gay, or because they are subject to broader urban processes?


if precise mechanisms are hard to identify, these explanations should nevertheless be associated with different patterns of change.

in the former case, gay neighborhoods should look similar to each other in terms of how they are changing, across cities and contexts. they should differ from neighborhoods in their same city

in the latter case, gay neighborhoods should look similar to other neighborhoods in their same city in terms of how they change, and less like other gay neighborhoods in different places

There are a number of smaller, necessary questions to build up to answering this big one that I first posed.

Can a set of gay neighborhoods to study be identified? Are they structurally similar to each other? Are they changing in similar ways? Are they changing in ways that differ from their respective contexts?

Underlying this proposed dilemma is the idea that there are different kinds of neighborhood change, and that our prior should be that these kinds of change are related.

On the one hand, there is cultural, institutional, or on-the-ground change. On the other there is structural or contextual change: changes in people, their characteristics, or economic conditions.

For gay neighborhoods, this means not *just* "degaying" [GHAZIANI], but should be experiencing broader urban change, more inclusive or expansive view of change. Certain kinds of change will be invisible through a quantitative lens---but not all kinds of change.

To see massive street-level upheaval that had no impact on or reflection in a neighborhood's demographics would be theoretically surprising. To see a host of bar closures that bore no relation to neighborhood economic conditions would be shocking and absurd

That is not what the "there goes the gayborhood" trope proposes.

that model is based on the presumed attraction, to straights, of queerness. that allure didn't exist before. this is the basis for expecting (bad) change in the gayborhood. we should see change reflected not just in bar closures or bachelorette parties, but in numbers as well.

in effect, we're victims of our own success., which is an intriguing social paradox with broader implications---if it's true.

so, are we? it says different things about what the problem is

why does this matter for queer folks? for marginalized groups in general?

different underlying problems, different solutions

what if the story isn't about us? then that's a different problem. let's talk about the neoliberal city, the right to the city, etc.

Capitol Hill may differ from Belltown in terms of symbolic importance, but not structurally.

the model in how I'd characterize Ghaziani's formulation, because we're in a post-gay era, gay neighborhoods are simultaneously less important to the gays, and more interesting (or at least less threatening) to the straights. this leads to neighborhood change, of both kinds described above.

What is different about gay neighborhoods?

What can this tell us about where gay spaces are going?

Is it at all relevant to the position of LGBTQ people?

need to explain here, clearly, what the problem I'm concerned with is and why

[do I bring up Ghaziani immediately, or wait till the background section?]

do we, actually, have reason to expect quantitative changes and qualitative changes to go together?

we have priors,

and we can at least put bounds on the kinds of change

combined cultural and structural change

I think so: if a bunch of straight, married, upper-middle-class white people are moving into these neighborhoods, that should show up in data.

Do we want to know what is happening quantitatively in gay spaces. I'm not analyzing populations here.

[IDEA: use 2008-2012 and 2012-2016 for same-sex couples. we're so close to being able to do that properly.]

In this paper, I begin to...

for instance, hypothetically, if it were the result of a nationwide trend in the changing social position of LGBTQ people

By this point, "there goes the gayborhood" is a trope [@brown_gender_2014; @ghaziani_there_2014; @smart_there_2016].

Is it? Shouldn't we be able to see that?

macro, micro, meso

First, I must state clearly what this project is not. It is not a macro-level analysis of what urban change is, or of where same-sex couples are located in metropolitan areas and how that has changed, as would be typical of quantitative approaches. Neither is it a micro-level examination of the stories of individual gay, LGBTQ, or queer neighborhoods, whether their recent history or their distant past, as a qualitative approach might favor.

Instead, this project is a meso-level investigation, a small-N study. It combines a qualitative approach to the incorporation of knowledge with quantitative techniques of analysis.

This is the grail.

But backing up a hot second, it turns out that there are several baseline questions to address first: how do we identify gay neighborhoods? do they look similar to each other? are they changing?

Coming up with at least provisional or pragmatic answer to those questions builds toward answering the big one

if these neighborhoods are changing, is it because they're gay? or is that somehow coincidental?

This could have deep, sensitive implications: *is this really about us?* *or are we victims of urban processes beyond our control?*

if what is happening to gay neighborhoods does not have anything to do with the fact that those neighborhoods are gay, how could it say anything about our position in society?

conversely, if what's happening here looks really different, maybe it is related

In asking this question

I am directly inspired by questions left open by Ghaziani [CITE] and others in the qualitative literature. I am further attempting to respond to calls to broaden the way we study gay urban geographies within sociology [CITE Amy Stone somehow - and also maybe G Brown 2008]

I'm not even concerned with whether these neighborhoods are becoming less *gay*. I am asking a simpler and broader question.

do we see coherent _ change? is that change different? can we ascribe it to the fact that these neighborhoods are distinguished or marked as gay?


I am not considering changes in prevalence or numbers of same-sex couples at all.

I am taking a broader, contextual view of neighborhood change, with the assumption that if contextual factors are changing, this will have some influence on or relation to changes on the ground, or at the level of culture and institutions.

We, queer academics, have stories we tell ourselves. What's the story? How justified is it?

Is it really about gay neighborhoods at all? Or are these places getting swept up in broader contextual trends?

PUT MY RESEARCH QUESTION SOMEWHERE as clearly as I can state it.
