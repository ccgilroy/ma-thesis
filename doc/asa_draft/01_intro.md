need to explain here, clearly, what the problem I'm concerned with is and why

[do I bring up Ghaziani immediately, or wait till the background section?]

do we, actually, have reason to expect quantitative changes and qualitative changes to go together?

we have priors,

and we can at least put bounds on the kinds of change

combined cultural and structural change

I think so: if a bunch of straight, married, upper-middle-class white people are moving into these neighborhoods, that should show up in data.

Do we want to know what is happening quantitatively in gay spaces. I'm not analyzing populations here.

[IDEA: use 2008-2012 and 2012-2016 for same-sex couples. we're so close to being able to do that properly.]

In this paper, I begin to...

for instance, hypothetically, if it were the result of a nationwide trend in the changing social position of LGBTQ people

bring up the trope, "there goes the gayborhood"

macro, micro, meso

First, I must state clearly what this project is not. It is not a macro-level analysis on what urban change is, or where same-sex couples are located in metropolitan areas, or how that's changed, as would be typical of quantitative approaches. Neither is it a micro-level examination of the stories of individual gay/LGBTQ/queer neighborhoods, whether their recent history or their distant past, as a qualitative approach might favor.

Instead, this project is a meso-level take, a small-N study. It combines a qualitative sensibility and quantitative techniques.

I am directly inspired by questions left open by Ghaziani [CITE] and others in the qualitative literature. I am further attempting to respond to calls to broaden the way we study gay urban geographies within sociology [CITE Amy Stone somehow - and also maybe G Brown 2008]

I'm not even concerned with whether these neighborhoods are becoming less *gay*. I am asking a simpler and broader question.

do we see coherent _ change? is that change different? can we ascribe it to the fact that these neighborhoods are distinguished or marked as gay?
