# Introduction

Are gay neighborhoods changing because they are gay---that is, because of their association with LGBTQ people, institutions, and culture? Or is it only because they are subject to broader urban processes? The oft-repeated idea that "there goes the gayborhood" [@brown_gender_2014; @ghaziani_there_2014; @smart_there_2016] implies the former. The relevance of these spaces has changed, with them becoming less important to LGBTQ people and more interesting or more accessible to straight people, and this results in changes to both institutional and residential dynamics, rendering gay neighborhoods less gay and otherwise transformed, generally for the worse.

If what we might think of as the success of LGBTQ movements, in terms of legal equality and public opinion change, results in the undermining of gay spaces [@ghaziani_there_2014; "isn't this what you wanted?"], that is an intriguing social paradox with broader implications. The other possibility, that the story is not about us, has different implications for LGBTQ people and socially marginalized groups more generally. Each explanation suggests different underlying problems with different potential solutions. Perhaps we should be talking less about the consequences of mobile gay dating apps, and more about neoliberalism and the right to the city [@harvey_right_2003].

So, *are our neighborhoods victims of our success, or of urban processes beyond our control?*

Underlying this proposed dilemma is the idea that there are different kinds of neighborhood change. On one hand, there is cultural, institutional, or on-the-ground change: changes in storefronts or symbols or crowds on the street. On the other there is structural or contextual change: changes in people, their characteristics, or economic conditions. We should suppose that these kinds of change are related. To see massive upheaval in street-level culture that had no impact on or reflection in a neighborhood's demographics would be logically puzzling. To see a host of bar closures that bore no relation to neighborhood economic conditions would be theoretically surprising. In fact, the "there goes the gayborhood" model implies that these changes are linked. If there are negative changes in gay neighborhoods, from the point of view of LGBTQ people invested in them, we should see those changes reflected not just in bar closures or bachelorette parties, but in numbers as well.

I would go one step further, and argue that the idea that gay neighborhoods are only "de-gaying" [@ghaziani_there_2014], as if each LGBTQ person were being substituted for an otherwise identical straight person, seems equally unlikely. We should take a more inclusive or expansive view of contextual urban change. This is critical because certain kinds of change will be invisible through a quantitative lens---for instance, the Census does not measure sexual identity at all---but not all kinds of change will be visible. Viewing changes as at least potentially linked opens up broader and simpler questions: are gay neighborhoods getting whiter? More educated? Have rents gone up?

[rather than "do we see an influx of straight, white, married couples"]

If precise mechanisms are hard to identify, these explanations should nevertheless be associated with different patterns of change. In the former case, gay neighborhoods should look similar to each other in terms of how they are changing, across cities and contexts. They should differ from neighborhoods in their same city. In the latter case, gay neighborhoods should look similar to other neighborhoods in their same city in terms of how they change, and less like other gay neighborhoods in different places.

To build up toward answering the initial, motivating question, there are a number of smaller necessary questions to address. Can a set of gay neighborhoods to study be identified? Are they structurally similar to each other? Are they changing in similar ways? Are they changing in ways that differ from their respective contexts? In this paper, I take on these questions sequentially, by combining institutional and contextual data about gay neighborhoods, and come up with at least provisional or pragmatic answers.

[Below might go to background]

First, I must state clearly what this project is not. It is not a macro-level analysis of what urban change is, or of where same-sex couples are located in metropolitan areas and how that has changed, as would be typical of quantitative approaches. Neither is it a micro-level examination of the stories of individual gay, LGBTQ, or queer neighborhoods, whether their recent history or their distant past, as a qualitative approach might favor.

Instead, this project is a meso-level investigation, a small-N study. It combines a qualitative approach to the incorporation of knowledge with quantitative techniques of analysis.

I am directly inspired by questions left open by Ghaziani [CITE] and others in the qualitative literature. I am further attempting to respond to calls to broaden the way we study gay urban geographies within sociology [CITE Amy Stone somehow - and also maybe G Brown 2008]
