This section should generate and justify my expectations

# Gay neighborhoods

Terminology matters.

"queer" might speak to a political orientation that is absent; "LGBTQ" to an inclusiveness that is missing

Go straight for Levine's definition, which has four parts

use the term "gay neighborhood"

not because it is neutral, but because it contains, I believe, the fewest connotations at odds with my purposes.

fn: Brown 2014 contains an excellent summary of the different terms that have been used in the academic literature.

prototypes do not have to be *representative*, either. The median gay neighborhood---if such a thing is even meaningful---would not look like Greenwich Village or the Castro.

Neighborhood boundaries could be sharp, or they could be fuzzy. They could be official, or informal. They could be universally accepted, or contested. In any case, my project needs boundaries. I use these boundaries pragmatically, and I do not claim that they are definitive.

[In fact, I can show you cases where insider knowledge might dispute the exact boundaries my rules and algorithms come up with.]

[acknowledge problems of reputation and analogy and categorization, @brown-saracino_what_2017]

I hear the calls to focus on the most peripheral spaces, and I am disregarding them. A key part of understanding the relationship between the core and the periphery is better characterizing the processes affecting the core. (I am, however, broadening my understanding of "core" from what is conventional.)

[CITE: Brown, Brown-Saracino, Mattson, Halberstam, Gray]

I am distinguishing between neighborhoods with a visible and marked gay presence and those where a queer presence undoubtedly exists, but is less visible or salient. (reluctant to call the rest of the neighborhoods "non-gay")

# Bars as institutions

Mattson, Ghaziani, Brown go here

Ghaziani calls these "anchor institutions"

; in fact, queer women's bars, like the Wildrose in Seattle or the Lexington in San Francisco, appear in my data (which are, nevertheless, biased toward men).

I regard this bias toward men as something to be demonstrated rather than assumed.

If the archetypical gay neighborhood is, or was, a space for middle-class cis white gay men, that should be reflected in the demographic attributes I can measure.

[FOOTNOTE] On lesbian bars and queer women's spaces see [LONG LIST: Podmore, Enke, Mattson], among others.

# Change in gay neighborhoods

*Gentrification* is the elephant in the room.

because that's an expectation, I should acknowledge it. And then say I am going to use the more neutral framing of "neighborhood change" precisely so as not to beg the question.

I may *expect* to see changes in gay neighborhoods consistent with what we might think of as gentrification, but I do not want to presume that.

What is distinct is that (again, by presumption) these gay neighborhoods start their lives as recognized, visibly gay spaces as middle-class, white neighborhoods---often ones that have *already* gone through one phase of gentrification from working class (white or POC) neighborhoods [CITE: Castells, Hanhardt]. This isn't surprising, though; we've got a proposed four-stage model of gay neighborhood development from Collins 2004. My research is happening against that backdrop, but I'm not actively testing the development process! I'm just looking at what's happening now. We need a better empirical handle on the range of changes we see---or don't see---before we can really examine how generalizable this proposed theoretical process is.

Collins

Finally, *residential segregation*

two important quantitative studies @spring_declining_2013 and

residential segregation does NOT get at neighborhood change. it's a different thing. that's okay.

the thing they care about is gay and lesbian *populations*, what I care about is what is happening to gay *spaces*.

Cite Spring, D'Lane...

propose radical idea that we *look at the object we purport to care about*

This is not totally new. In some ways it is a throwback to the work of Levine and Castells from the beginnings of the study of gay neighborhoods.

One important innovation I will make is to cluster and filter observations

What they got out of using multiple measures, I will attempt to extract from one, more or less.

I will do this by applying a level of skepticism to the data: one gay bar does not make a gay neighborhood; a cluster of them does.

The reason to make this tradeoff is that it makes it feasible to include many more cities (than one, two, or five).

@doan_demise_2011, @hayslett_out_2011, and @smart_there_2016 come closest to the spirit of what I attempt to do here.

I trade their nuanced focuses on single cities---Atlanta, Columbus, and Dallas, respectively---for breadth of comparison.

(What also distinguishes these studies from others is their focus on cities outside the core of the gay urban imaginary of New York, San Francisco, and Chicago.)
