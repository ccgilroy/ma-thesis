This section should generate and justify my expectations

# gay neighborhoods

Terminology matters.

"queer" might speak to a political orientation that is absent; "LGBTQ" to an inclusiveness that is missing

Go straight for Levine's definition, which has four parts

use the term "gay neighborhood"

fn: Brown 2014 contains an excellent summary of the different terms that have been used in the academic literature.

prototypes do not have to be *representative*, either. The median gay neighborhood---if such a thing is even meaningful---would not look like Greenwich Village or the Castro.

Neighborhood boundaries could be sharp, or they could be fuzzy. They could be official, or informal. They could be universally accepted, or contested. In any case, my project needs boundaries. I use these boundaries pragmatically, and I do not claim that they are definitive.

[In fact, I can show you cases where insider knowledge might dispute the exact boundaries my rules and algorithms come up with.]

# bars as institutions

Mattson, Ghaziani, Brown go here

; in fact, queer women's bars appear in my data (which are, nevertheless, biased toward men)

I regard this bias toward men as something to be demonstrated rather than assumed.

If the archetypical gay neighborhood is, or was, a space for middle-class cis white gay men, that should be reflected in the demographic attributes I can measure.

# gay neighborhood change

*Gentrification* is the elephant in the room.

Collins

Finally, *residential segregation*

two important quantitative studies

residential segregation does NOT get at neighborhood change. it's a different thing. that's okay.

the thing they care about is gay and lesbian *populations*, what I care about is what is happening to gay *spaces*.

Cite Spring, D'Lane...

propose radical idea that we *look at the object we purport to care about*

This is not totally new. In some ways it is a throwback to the work of Levine and Castells from the beginnings of the study of gay neighborhoods.

One important innovation I will make is to cluster and filter observations

What they got out of using multiple measures, I will attempt to extract from one, more or less.

The reason to make this tradeoff is that it makes it feasible to include many more cities (than one, two, or five).

@doan_demise_2011, @hayslett_out_2011, and @smart_there_2016 come closest to the spirit of what I attempt to do here.

I trade their nuanced focuses on single cities---Atlanta, Columbus, and Dallas, respectively---for breadth of comparison.

(What also distinguishes these studies from others is their focus on cities outside the core of the gay urban imaginary of New York, San Francisco, and Chicago.)
