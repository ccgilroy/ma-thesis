# Background

## Gay neighborhoods

I use the term "gay neighborhood" pragmatically to refer to the object of my study.[^gay_terminology] "Queer" might speak to a radical political orientation that is absent in a space that is ultimately homonormative [@hanhardt_safe_2013, @mattson_style_2014]; "LGBTQ" to an inclusiveness or diversity that is missing or insufficient.

[^gay_terminology]: @brown_gender_2014 contains an excellent summary of the different terms that have been used in the academic literature to name gay neighborhoods.

Drawing on the urban sociology of the Chicago school, @levine_gay_1979 [364] uses four criteria to define and identify a gay neighborhood: gay institutions, gay culture, gay residents, and a level of social isolation. The multifaceted nature of this definition is important, because it allows for gradations wherein some neighborhoods are more prototypically or clearly gay neighborhoods than others. Prototypes for a social category, however, do not have to be *representative*. The median gay neighborhood---if such a thing is even meaningful---would not look exactly like Greenwich Village or the Castro, though it would be recognized to have something in common.

The categorization problem of dichotomizing neighborhoods into those marked as gay and those that are not is a common one in researching social objects. The bounds of individual neighborhoods also share in this problem. Neighborhood boundaries could be sharp, or they could be fuzzy. They could be official, or informal. They could be universally accepted, or contested. In any case, my project requires boundaries. I use these boundaries pragmatically, and I do not claim that they are definitive.

@castells_city_1983, who like Levine uses multiple criteria in his classic study of gay territoriality in San Francisco, finds that his are generally consistent with each other. This raises the possibility of using one aspect of a gay neighborhood as a proxy for the whole. In this work, I will use one criterion---the locations of gay bars---rather than multiple, because it is widespread and measurable, enabling an analysis across multiple cities.

## Bars as institutions

This paper is about gay neighborhoods, not gay bars. But gay bars are what @ghaziani_measuring_2014 calls "anchor institutions," proposing that they be used to measure the ties of urban sexual cultures to particular places. Gay neighborhoods and gay bars are closely enough associated that Pew, in their survey of LGBT Americans, asks about the continuing importance of the two in the same question [@pew_research_center_survey_2013].

The approach I adopt based on clusters of gay bars deliberately focuses attention on what I would think of as core or central gay spaces rather than the periphery [@brown_queering_2008; @halberstam_queer_2005]. At the same time, gay bar cultures and styles can be heterogeneous [@mattson_style_2014], so using them as a proxy should uncover a range of gay neighborhoods. Nevertheless, potential biases of my chosen approach must be acknowledged, the most significant of these being a bias toward queer men over queer women. Unlike the classic works of @levine_gay_1979 and @castells_city_1983, I will not a priori restrict the domain of my research to men. Instead, I regard this potential bias toward gay men as something to be demonstrated rather than assumed.[^lesbian_bars] If the archetypical gay neighborhood is, or was, a space for middle-class, cisgender, white gay men, that should be reflected in the demographic attributes I can measure.

[^lesbian_bars]: In fact, queer women's bars, like the Wildrose in Seattle or the Lexington in San Francisco, appear in my data (which are, nevertheless, biased toward men on the whole). On lesbian bars and queer women's spaces see @podmore_gone_2006 and @enke_finding_2007, among others.

## Change in gay neighborhoods

change in spaces, not populations. micro/macro scales

*Gentrification* is a particular kind of neighborhood change, with contested definitions and a significant debate over its prevalence and impact [@brown-saracino_explicating_2017]. I do not want to presume that this is the process operating across all gay spaces, but when discussing change in gay neighborhoods the specter of gentrification is unavoidable [@castells_city_1983; @lauria_toward_1985; @knopp_theoretical_1990; @collins_sexual_2004; @ruting_economic_2008; @hanhardt_safe_2013; @mattson_style_2014]. In particular, the four-stage model of gay neighborhood development and decline articulated by @collins_sexual_2004, beginning with an influx of gay institutions and people into a "declining" area and ending with integration and emigration, provides an implicit backdrop for any work in this area, including mine. Where this current work fits in is not in terms of testing how generalizable that proposed theoretical process is. Rather, it empirically establishes the range of changes than can be seen---or not seen---in gay neighborhoods, and how distinct those changes are.

A framing more common in demographic approaches is *residential segregation*. Two important quantitative studies, @spring_declining_2013 and @poston_jr_residential_2017, have examined the existence of and change in residential segregation between different-sex and same-sex couples using Census data. My point is that, though it is conceptually and logically related, residential segregation at the city or metropolitan-area level does not measure the same thing as neighborhood change. Though her work is adopted by @ghaziani_there_2014 and others, @spring_declining_2013 in particular explicitly states that her work is not meant to draw inferences about neighborhoods. I depart from this demographic approach to look at neighborhoods directly. My analysis, instead of looking at the fates of gay and lesbian *populations*, shifts the question to examining what is happening to gay *spaces*.

Therefore, my work occupies this space

does NOT get at neighborhood change. it's a different thing. that's okay.

the thing they care about is gay and lesbian *populations*, what I care about is what is happening to gay *spaces*.

Cite Spring, D'Lane...

This study attempts neither of those things

rather

## recap: what I hope to accomplish

To recapitulate what I aim to accomplish,

propose radical idea that we *look at the object we purport to care about*

This is not totally new. In some ways it is a throwback to the work of Levine and Castells from the beginnings of the study of gay neighborhoods.

One important innovation I will make is to cluster and filter observations

What they got out of using multiple measures, I will attempt to extract from one, more or less.

I will do this by applying a level of skepticism to the data: one gay bar does not make a gay neighborhood; a cluster of them does.

The reason to make this tradeoff is that it makes it feasible to include many more cities (than one, two, or five).

@doan_demise_2011, @hayslett_out_2011, and @smart_there_2016 come closest to the spirit of what I attempt to do here.

I trade their nuanced focuses on single cities---Atlanta, Columbus, and Dallas, respectively---for breadth of comparison.

(What also distinguishes these studies from others is their focus on cities outside the core of the gay urban imaginary of New York, San Francisco, and Chicago.)


it isn't possible to create a perfectly accurate definition of "gay neighborhood" that both works universally and is empirically feasible.

The definition I use is tailored to my problem and my project.

I trust random gays on the internet to tell me where gay bars are more than I trust the Census to tell me where same-sex couples are. If you don't, I can't help you.

[@brown_gender_2014] is part of the call I am responding to!
