This section should generate and justify my expectations

# gay neighborhoods

Go straight for Levine's definition, which has four parts

# bars as institutions

# gay neighborhood change

*Gentrification* is the elephant in the room.

Finally, *residential segregation*

two important quantitative studies

residential segregation does NOT get at neighborhood change. it's a different thing. that's okay.

the thing they care about is gay and lesbian *populations*, what I care about is what is happening to gay *spaces*.

Cite Spring, D'Lane...

propose radical idea that we *look at the object we purport to care about*

This is not totally new. In some ways it is a throwback to the work of Levine and Castells from the beginnings of the study of gay neighborhoods.

One important innovation I will make is to cluster and filter observations

What they got out of using multiple measures, I will attempt to extract from one, more or less.

The reason to make this tradeoff is that it makes it feasible to include many more cities (than one, two, or five).
