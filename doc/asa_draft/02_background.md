# Background

## Gay neighborhoods

I use the term "gay neighborhood" pragmatically to refer to the object of my study.[^gay_terminology] "Queer" might speak to a radical political orientation that is absent in a space that is ultimately homonormative [@hanhardt_safe_2013]; "LGBTQ" to an inclusiveness or diversity that is missing or insufficient.

[^gay_terminology]: @brown_gender_2014 contains an excellent summary of the different terms that have been used in the academic literature to name gay neighborhoods.

Drawing on the urban sociology of the Chicago school, @levine_gay_1979 [364] uses four criteria to define a gay neighborhood: gay institutions, gay culture, gay residents, and a level of social isolation. The multifaceted nature of this definition is important, because it allows for gradations wherein some neighborhoods are more prototypically or clearly gay neighborhoods than others. Prototypes for a social category, however, do not have to be *representative*. The median gay neighborhood---if such a thing is even meaningful---would not look exactly like Greenwich Village or the Castro, though it would be recognize to have something in common.

@castells_city_1983, however, who also uses multiple criteria in his classic study, finds that his are generally consistent with each other. This raises the possibility of using one aspect of a gay neighborhood as a proxy for the whole. In this work, I will use one criterion---the locations of gay bars---rather than multiple, because it is widespread and measurable, enabling an analysis across multiple cities.

Neighborhood boundaries could be sharp, or they could be fuzzy. They could be official, or informal. They could be universally accepted, or contested. In any case, my project needs boundaries. I use these boundaries pragmatically, and I do not claim that they are definitive.

[In fact, I can show you cases where insider knowledge might dispute the exact boundaries my rules and algorithms come up with.]

[acknowledge problems of reputation and analogy and categorization, @brown-saracino_what_2017]

I hear the calls to focus on the most peripheral spaces, and I am disregarding them. A key part of understanding the relationship between the core and the periphery is better characterizing the processes affecting the core. (I am, however, broadening my understanding of "core" from what is conventional.)

I am distinguishing between neighborhoods with a visible and marked gay presence and those where a queer presence undoubtedly exists, but is less visible or salient. (reluctant to call the rest of the neighborhoods "non-gay")

## Bars as institutions

This paper is about gay neighborhoods, not gay bars.

But gay bars are what @ghaziani_measuring_2014 calls "anchor institutions."

Neighborhoods and bars are closely enough associated that Pew, in their survey of LGBT Americans, asks about the importance of the two in the same question [@pew_research_center_survey_2013].

bias toward men

I will not a priori restrict the domain of my research to men. Instead, I regard this potential bias toward gay men as something to be demonstrated rather than assumed.[^lesbian_bars] If the archetypical gay neighborhood is, or was, a space for middle-class, cisgender, white gay men, that should be reflected in the demographic attributes I can measure.

[^lesbian_bars]: In fact, queer women's bars, like the Wildrose in Seattle or the Lexington in San Francisco, appear in my data (which are, nevertheless, biased toward men). On lesbian bars and queer women's spaces see @podmore_gone_2006 and @enke_finding_2007, among others.

## Change in gay neighborhoods: spaces, not populations



*Gentrification* is the elephant in the room.

because that's an expectation, I should acknowledge it. And then say I am going to use the more neutral framing of "neighborhood change" precisely so as not to beg the question.

I may *expect* to see changes in gay neighborhoods consistent with what we might think of as gentrification, but I do not want to presume that.

What is distinct is that (again, by presumption) these gay neighborhoods start their lives as recognized, visibly gay spaces as middle-class, white neighborhoods---often ones that have *already* gone through one phase of gentrification from working class (white or POC) neighborhoods [CITE: Castells, Hanhardt]. This isn't surprising, though; we've got a proposed four-stage model of gay neighborhood development from Collins 2004. My research is happening against that backdrop, but I'm not actively testing the development process! I'm just looking at what's happening now. We need a better empirical handle on the range of changes we see---or don't see---before we can really examine how generalizable this proposed theoretical process is.

Finally, *residential segregation*

two important quantitative studies @spring_declining_2013 and @poston_jr_residential_2017

residential segregation does NOT get at neighborhood change. it's a different thing. that's okay.

the thing they care about is gay and lesbian *populations*, what I care about is what is happening to gay *spaces*.

Cite Spring, D'Lane...


## recap: what I hope to accomplish

propose radical idea that we *look at the object we purport to care about*

This is not totally new. In some ways it is a throwback to the work of Levine and Castells from the beginnings of the study of gay neighborhoods.

One important innovation I will make is to cluster and filter observations

What they got out of using multiple measures, I will attempt to extract from one, more or less.

I will do this by applying a level of skepticism to the data: one gay bar does not make a gay neighborhood; a cluster of them does.

The reason to make this tradeoff is that it makes it feasible to include many more cities (than one, two, or five).

@doan_demise_2011, @hayslett_out_2011, and @smart_there_2016 come closest to the spirit of what I attempt to do here.

I trade their nuanced focuses on single cities---Atlanta, Columbus, and Dallas, respectively---for breadth of comparison.

(What also distinguishes these studies from others is their focus on cities outside the core of the gay urban imaginary of New York, San Francisco, and Chicago.)


it isn't possible to create a perfectly accurate definition of "gay neighborhood" that both works universally and is empirically feasible.

The definition I use is tailored to my problem and my project.


I trust random gays on the internet to tell me where gay bars are more than I trust the Census to tell me where same-sex couples are. If you don't, I can't help you.
