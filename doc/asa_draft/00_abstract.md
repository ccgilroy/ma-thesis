# Abstract

This paper begins to address whether it is the unique characteristics of gay neighborhoods that lead them to undergo change across the board, or whether only some of them are coincidentally impacted by broader urban processes. These explanations carry different implications about the nature of the problem facing LGBTQ people and other marginalized groups looking to understand change in their community spaces. I investigate economic and demographic change, which has been purported to be associated with known cultural and institutional changes in gay neighborhoods, by comparison to other neighborhoods and to citywide contexts. The paper links a new data source of gay bar listings from the mid-2000s to American Community Survey data, constructing neighborhoods for which broad profiles of change can be examined. While preliminary results show that gay neighborhoods cohere on a variety of contextual characteristics, including gender, race, educational attainment, and household types, I find mixed support for the idea that they are changing in a systematic way. In my final models, I expect to be able to show a weakening in support for the idea that something fundamentally related to the gay nature of the spaces, like social regard for LGBTQ people or lack of attachment by LGBTQ people to gay neighborhoods, is driving demographic change in gay neighborhoods.
