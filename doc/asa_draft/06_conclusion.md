# Discussion and conclusion

Talk about bridging quantitative and qualitative approaches here.

Ultimately, though my techniques are quantitative, my sensibilities are qualitative.

I don't know how legible this work will be to quantitative researchers.

This paper has taken advantage of the strengths of ACS data from the Census Bureau by looking at the center rather than the margins.

I can do this by shifting the question from *what's happening to gay people* to *what's happening in gay spaces*.

Implicitly, the latter tells us something about the former.

places and populations

(spaces and)

(and communities)
