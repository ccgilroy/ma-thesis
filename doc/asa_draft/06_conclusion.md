# Discussion and conclusion

On one hand, I have shown enough to justify concerns and perceptions of contextual coherence

At the same time, we should be wary of ascribing too much unity to the category of gay neighborhood.

we cannot conclude that these neighborhoods, as a trend, are getting whiter or straighter

of course,

Talk about bridging quantitative and qualitative approaches here.

Ultimately, though my techniques are quantitative, my sensibilities are qualitative.

I don't know how legible this work will be to quantitative researchers.

This paper has taken advantage of the strengths of ACS data from the Census Bureau by looking at the center rather than the margins.

I have accomplished this in two ways:

first, taking a broader, meso-scale view of gay neighborhoods across more cities than previous scholars doing either qualitative or quantitative work on one or few cities.

second, relative to demographic analyses, by shifting the question from *what's happening to gay people* to *what's happening in gay spaces*.

Implicitly, of course, the latter tells us something about the former.

places and populations

(spaces and)

(and communities)

Richard Florida attempted to make LGBTQ people into a symbol of "coolness", creativity, and diversity. Perhaps that is a negative thing for gay spaces.

what are the implications

two implications / interpretations

something that's really about the social position of LGBTQ people in American society, and the corresponding social position of gay neighborhoods in US cities.

or

differ only in terms of symbolic impact: LGBTQ people care about these neighborhoods because our communities are impacted

Which story is closer to the truth?

Do I say I find mixed evidence?

Gay neighborhoods are definitely a thing.
