# clustering and filtering

[show maps - result of clustering AND filtering]

my point is not that these couldn't be contested! they could!

and this is *almost* enough that the margins of error don't overlap on some things! which is good.

talk about types and failures

See [APPENDIX] for more maps

I choose the 24 cities that most clearly have

This is done inductively, based on literature and inspection of the clusters

New York has three, San Francisco and Chicago have two, and all other included cities have one.

[FOOTNOTE] Long Beach, in Los Angeles County, is collapsed together with Los Angeles proper for discussions of context. This nominally gives LA two neighborhoods, as well.

[FOOTNOTE] Alternative specifications using the largest cluster for each city, or all clusters, regardless of size or relevance, and finally as individual tracts---which would be the conventional demographic approach. At the moment, I can only claim that my approach is preferable to these in a qualitative sense.

tracts: 488, 461 with downtowns excluded, and 146 in filtered components.

range of components:

largest by number of tracts is West Village - Chelsea, NY with 13

largest by number of bars is Castro - Mission - Folsom - SOMA, SF with 33.

smallest by number of tracts are Northcentral, San Antonio, and Ybor City, Tampa, with 1 each.

smallest by number of bars is South Beach, Miami, with 4

I think I have a narrative for these now.

I'm concerned about the (lack of) coherence in the results I have so far. But how clear was I expecting it to be? Also, I ostensibly planned for this.

Story I'd like to be able to tell: starts out as a mess, but then a narrative emerges when we cluster the data sensibly.

Seems clear that part of the problem is I don't know how these neighborhoods are doing relative to their contexts.

PCA: kind of have to decide that variation on different axes is equally important.

Correlation:

Could just look at whether these are different from all other tracts in same city, but then I lose the effect of the aggregation

Talk about building synthetic controls from other census tracts in "conclusions" if I don't get to it. "I plan to..."


Where do these neighborhoods start? Where do they wind up? In absolute terms? and relative to their contexts? and relative to comparable neighborhoods at the beginning?

To confirm, would need to look at


I expect to see economic and demographic changes to go along with {X}



It sounds like emphasizing heterogeneity is going to be important. Even among this, the set of neighborhoods I've chosen to be most clearly

This point holds up looking at one-way plots and at diffs for individual tracts (which I don't want to use, because measurement error)

if the story winds up being: demographics are pretty muddled, but economics show clear trends

that's okay.

Okay, education is pretty coherent, especially with income / rent.

Boystown and Andersonville are both pretty flat on the education front. What does this mean for the criticism we made of Ghaziani two years ago?
