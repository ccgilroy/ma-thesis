# Main argument for introduction

- Gay neighborhoods are a case of urban change and majority-minority relations
    - We think they exist
    - We think they exist for reasons
    - These reasons are not unique
    - [This is still not interesting to me]
    - If what we think are the reasons change, we should observe change
    - DO WE?!?
    - Maybe not, y'all
- Argument for recent, widespread change/decline
- This is possibly overstated
- What if it's not unique to / common among gay neighborhoods, but localized to particular contexts?
- here's how I'll go about adding to that conversation

# Introduction

> "When we use the phrase 'gay community' we are implying something more than a gay territory and an open gay life style. We are referring to a deliberate effort by gay people to set up their own organizations and institutions in all spheres of life."

Neighborhood enclaves identified with particular minority communities are a feature of cities. They arise in response to forces such as social stigma and economic disadvantage pushing minority groups apart from the rest of urban society, and cultural factors such as language, religion, and a desire for community pulling them together. [Alternatively, 'involuntary' and 'voluntary' reasons for segregation.] Because cities are large and heterogeneous, they can support the existence of homophilic and homogeneous enclaves, which can develop institutions and cultures of their own: "small worlds" within the large world of the city [@wirth_ghetto_1928; @wirth_urbanism_1938]. While these enclaves are most commonly thought of in terms of race and ethnicity, which do dominate the spatial organization of the American city, other social characteristics such as sexuality may also form the basis for a spatial community.

Conditions of isolation and disadvantage give rise to minority urban enclaves. What happens when those conditions change? Do minority neighborhoods respond to historical shifts, from isolation to more widespread acceptance, by integrating and thereby declining in distinctness? Or are any observed neighborhood changes instead part of the normal and continuous evolution and flux of urban spaces? Perhaps minority neighborhoods continue to fulfill some of their previous purposes even in absence of the pressures of stigma and isolation, or perhaps they otherwise persist simply through inertia. Change cannot be taken for granted, and the reasons for change cannot be assumed. [Is that too pretentious? I don't know anymore.]

Gay neighborhoods provide a classic case of minority urban enclaves, alongside Jewish and Black ghettos [@castells_cultural_1983, 158]. Important differences of history aside, they possess many of the same structural characteristics as these other enclaves [@levine_gay_1979]. Because they represent a distinct case, gay neighborhoods offer an opportunity to consider urban dynamics beyond race, ethnicity, and class. Studying them can add to our general knowledge of how minority enclaves change in response to their local urban contexts and broader shifting circumstances.

often thought of in terms of race and ethnicity [because these factors do dominate the spatial organization of the city], but

[don't say ghetto, say enclave]

What happens when those conditions change?

the whole damn point of cities is that they are large and heterogeneous [Wirth 1938, Simmel whenever]

Social stigma, economic inequality, and cultural factors like language and religion

render distinctive minority enclaves a part of urban ecology [fabric]. [blech]

If the conditions which produced a minority neighborhood change, do those neighborhoods correspondingly change or decline?

Or are

or are changes part of normal, continuous urban evolution and flux, rather than historical shifts

Minority urban communities, self-contained

in response to push and pull factors

[BUT THIS BELOW IS REALLY THE POINT OF DEPARTURE FOR THE PAPER. THE FACT THAT GAY NEIGHBORHOODS EXIST FOR REASONS IS JUST BACKGROUND.]

The point of departure for this study is the observation that

Some gay neighborhoods seem to be undergoing rapid cultural and institutional change, undermining their status and character as gay neighborhoods. The explanation proffered for this observed cultural change is demographic change: LGBTQ people move out of gay neighborhoods, and straight people move in.

Two processes potentially drive this demographic shift. First, increasing acceptance of LGBTQ people into heterosexual American society removes social barriers to assimilation. These social barriers had encouraged LGBTQ people to remain in gay enclaves, and had discouraged straight people from moving into them. Second, economic shifts in urban centers drive advanced gentrification in gay neighborhoods, resulting in the displacement of LGBTQ residents. These two processes are not mutually exclusive; they could occur in tandem. However, they are distinct, with distinct consequences and remedies. Therefore, we should consider which process predominates.

This phenomenon of recent, linked cultural and demographic change in gay neighborhoods is widely called "there goes the gayborhood" [@brown_gender_2014; @ghaziani_there_2014; @smart_there_2016; @james_there_2017; @albright_there_2018]. [by those who believe it, and those who question its extent]. Assimilation and gentrification lead to demographic changes. Demographic changes lead to cultural and institutional changes. Cultural and institutional changes lead to the loss of recognizable gay neighborhoods.

The evidence for this phenomenon, however, comes from a limited number of cases. These studies are most often qualitative observations of cultural and institutional change, with the concomitant demographic change being presumed or implied. This study takes a broader view, examining demographic and economic change directly across a range of gay neighborhoods. This examination establishes the extent of different types of gay neighborhood change. By analytically leveraging other neighborhoods for comparison, it also lets us distinguish between causes of gay neighborhood change tied to the changing status of LGBTQ people, whether assimilation-based or gentrification-based, or causes tied to local urban changes.

[nope, not just that.]

For these changes to have sprung from the shifting status of LGBTQ people in US society, whether solely or in combination with economic shifts, they should be recent and widespread. What if they are not?

[that wording isn't good, do better]

WHY have scholars made calls for broader approaches? Otherwise, our knowledge might be limited. We wouldn't even know what we don't know. Can't speak to generalizability.
