# Main argument

- Gay neighborhoods are a case of urban change and majority-minority relations
- Argument for recent, widespread change/decline
- This is possibly overstated
- What if it's not unique to / common among gay neighborhoods, but localized to particular contexts?
- here's how I'm gonna go about adding to that conversation

# Introduction

> "When we use the phrase 'gay community' we are implying something more than a gay territory and an open gay life style. We are referring to a deliberate effort by gay people to set up their own organizations and institutions in all spheres of life." â€” @castells_cultural_1983

[say something more general before this]

Minority urban communities, self-contained

in response to push and pull factors

have been a central feature of the diversity of cities

minority communities / territorial expression. [quote/cite metropolis and mental life?]

gay neighborhoods are one instance of this

Gay neighborhoods are one case of ...

Some gay neighborhoods seem to be undergoing rapid cultural and institutional change, undermining their status and character as gay neighborhoods. The explanation proffered for this observed cultural change is demographic change: LGBTQ people move out of gay neighborhoods, and straight people move in.

Two processes potentially drive this demographic shift. First, increasing acceptance of LGBTQ people into heterosexual American society removes social barriers to assimilation. These social barriers had encouraged LGBTQ people to remain in gay enclaves, and had discouraged straight people from moving into them. Second, economic shifts in urban centers drive advanced gentrification in gay neighborhoods, resulting in the displacement of LGBTQ residents. These two processes are not mutually exclusive; they could occur in tandem. However, they are distinct, with distinct consequences and remedies. Therefore, we should consider which process predominates.

This phenomenon of recent, linked cultural and demographic change in gay neighborhoods is widely called "there goes the gayborhood" [@brown_gender_2014; @ghaziani_there_2014; @smart_there_2016; @james_there_2017; @albright_there_2018]. [by those who believe it, and those who question its extent]. Assimilation and gentrification lead to demographic changes. Demographic changes lead to cultural and institutional changes. Cultural and institutional changes lead to the loss of recognizable gay neighborhoods.

The evidence for this phenomenon, however, comes from a limited number of cases. These studies are most often qualitative observations of cultural and institutional change, with the concomitant demographic change being presumed or implied. This study takes a broader view, examining demographic and economic change directly across a range of gay neighborhoods. This examination establishes the extent of different types of gay neighborhood change. By analytically leveraging other neighborhoods for comparison, it also lets us distinguish between assimilation-based or gentrification-based causes of gay neighborhood change.

[nope, not just that.]

For these changes to have sprung from the shifting status of LGBTQ people in US society, whether solely or in combination with economic shifts, they should be recent and widespread. What if they are not?

[that wording sucks, do better]

WHY have scholars made calls for broader approaches? Otherwise, our knowledge might be limited. We wouldn't even know what we don't know. Can't speak to generalizability.
