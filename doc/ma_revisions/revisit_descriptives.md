should I get county-level characteristics? especially so I can plot median income, median rent

I do wonder if proportion in poverty and proportion owner-occupied housing would make for more symmetric measures. broader profiles of change

did I fuck up median rent and median income by not taking weighted averages? if so, FIX THAT

compare to my modeling code (where I discard the MOEs)

really should get just straight up county level estimates

I'm really damn worried about the margins of error... I think I just need to push ahead, and prepare to revise if the 2000-2010 results turn out differently. That's all I can do for now. [and, again, still better than Gene Balk or whoever]

[it's a problem to solve for publication]

I think I'll still see patterns when I see patterns, and not when I don't

---

I think what's going on is less that they only know what's happening in particular cities, and more that they haven't looked at the numbers

the prop male stuff, esp re SF, is an argument for heterogeneous city-specific processes of change, right.

in both cases, looking at more cities or fewer doesn't really change the story. [but the story is seldom consistent with the TGTG model in the first place]

# look at male X married

a large number of these places are getting more male and more married
Andersonville, ironically, is the only one that shows a pattern of assimilation
in this time period...
SF is getting more male, less married, which is consistent with TECH BRO
LOTS are getting more male AND more married, which is plausible thinking about
the economic clout of men vs women, but still odd (odd is what I want, though)
the ones that start relatively low on both are most prone to increases.
the two that get more married, less male, are the ones that were most married to begin with
(i.e. the least gayborhood)

there are no -, - cities in the traditional group
those are ... mostly Florida, again.

what about the fact that most gayborhoods DO seem to be increasing in proportion married

... but this falls out in the statistical models, which show them, at minimum, increasing less than comparable neighborhoods

[how much of this is the back-to-the-city from the suburbs thing?]

# look at education X income

(basically) nowhere has its education and income go down
a couple places, mostly LA, have income go down, lol
everywhere else it goes up
story gets a little more complicated if we add all of the places
those two most educated places that also decrease in income are
West Hollywood and Hell's Kitchen ... two places that we think
from other sources remain pretty gay (HK is a new gayborhood in Ghaziani's terms)


A few places,


The cities in Florida (Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Tampa) are odd.

Hell's Kitchen is a "new" gay neighborhood, in Ghaziani's terms.

In terms of model interpretations, increasing more slowly, not decreasing


Andersonville, which Ghaziani marks as the new gay neighborhood in Chicago, and a target for directed queer migration, is one of the neighborhoods becoming less male and more married.

# observations

also mapped

HK in NYC definitely looks different from the other two gayborhoods in NYC

Florida is weird

it still surprises me that so many places are getting more male and more married

is there a typology? does it make sense to cluster based on changes?

I'm not necessarily feeling that. There are some patterns, and some outliers. (COUGH FLORIDA COUGH)

# tables of averages

[need to update, split out matched tracts]

# compare to county-level contexts

[need to get this data, so I can have median rent, median income]

[for all of my summaries, need to fix population density]


# email summary to Kate and Emilio

I've revisited my descriptive plots, and broken them down by directional trends. This makes overall patterns clearer, but largely doesn't change my interpretations. More gay neighborhoods are increasing in proportion married than I realized; in that light, my model results would mean that they're increasing more slowly than other neighborhoods.

Better-studied gay neighborhoods (in SF, NYC, Chicago, LA, Boston, Seattle) don't differ from less-studied ones. They're either consistent (for education X income) or heterogeneous (for married X male).

In terms of regional patterns, Florida and Los Angeles are the main places with increasing education and decreasing incomes. The few neighborhoods getting less male and less married are also mostly in Florida.

Some specific neighborhoods provide more evidence for local heterogeneity, rather than national patterns. Hell's Kitchen in NYC, which Ghaziani notes as a "new" gay neighborhood, is another place with increasing education and decreasing income—distinct from Chelsea and Greenwich Village, which are both getting wealthier. By contrast, Andersonville in Chicago, another new gay neighborhood which Ghaziani focuses on as a destination for directed queer migration, is actually becoming more married and less male. Finally, both neighborhoods in San Francisco (Castro and Polk) are increasingly male and less married, which suggests that the "tech bro" problem is a real limitation there.

# what's my beef with Ghaziani?

he overinterprets Spring, Gates, and Balk. there's a gap between

it's because they're too broad. Spring isn't just looking at places with gay neighborhoods.

more work is necessary to connect point A (national change across major urban areas) to point B (local change in specific gay neighborhoods). I do that work here.

Ghaziani finds widespread evidence of *concern*, but less of actual *change*

I want to back up: not "why is this happening now?" but "is this happening now?"

I do need to seriously read his media work.

codes for "assimilation" "gay residential choice" "straight residential choice" [choice is a strong word...]

across about 600 articles. most of the cities he cites are ones I include, except Detroit and Pittsburgh

media accounts of gay neighborhoods express a variety of reasons for why gay residents live there [@ghaziani_there_2014] (and different reasons for the straights)

I don't understand what these results are supposed to show...

notable that "anxieties" only start to show up in the last stage, from 2007 onward

note! my descriptives suggest that Sacramento and San Antonio really are marginal here; maybe they don't belong as gay neighborhoods at all. but I do want to broaden my analysis beyond the coasts.

> Are gay neighborhoods really disappearing? There is quite a buzz about this question. Demographers who analyze the US Census confirm that zip codes associated with traditional gay neighborhoods are "deconcentrating" and becoming less "segregated," to use their words, across the entire country.

I include every single city and neighborhood Ghaziani lists on page 2 except the ones in Canada. He lists 11 cities, but weirdly not Chicago. I cover everything he does, and then some. [except Detroit and Pittsburgh]

[Ghaziani goes on to list what gay neighborhoods do on p2-3, with a footnote of citations]


"culture area", "set the tone", visibility: an invisible gay neighborhood is not a gay neighborhood by this definition

I don't get the need for a dichotomy between economic power and cultural meaning [p7-8]... makes me think that, at minimum, Ghaziani could use some Bourdieu up in here.

# tech bros

you know what? the tech bro DOESN'T look totally identical to the young single gay man. He's making six figures. He's much wealthier. THAT'S the salient feature of tech bros.

"structurally equivalent"? NOPE. and, even if the gay techies are more likely than the straight ones to live in gay neighborhoods, given the same means, THERE ARE STILL MORE STRAIGHT ONES. and if there are a lot of them, like in SF and Seattle, they do what they do best, and DISRUPT.

seriously, what are the odds that a tech bro is replacing or displacing someone with a similar six-figure salary? do we actually believe that? no, we don't.

# demographic signature

Gay neighborhoods have a demographic signature: educated, male, unmarried, white

This is exactly what @castells_cultural_1983 would have said from looking only at the Castro.

But these are TRENDS, not universals.

HETEROGENEITY within and among gay neighborhoods is a part of this.

Majority male, but no more than 60%. Majority white, but with racial diversity.

# for Sarah

what is our prior on the number of gay neighborhoods in the United States? this may seem a nonsensical question, but it's a useful thought experiment

the methods problem here is the relationship between numbers and meaning
