# Discussion and conclusions

## Limitations


**There are shortcomings to the fact that I cannot measure neighborhood residents' sexualities directly.**

Influx of young, single, male technology workers who are straight would be demographically indistinguishable

In the West Coast cities of San Francisco and Seattle, this demographic is consequential.


**The time scale is an issue.**

Future work should examine change going back to 2000.

There would be little advantage to examining change before 2000, because there is no competing explanation to contend with.

Concern over gay neighborhood change only intensifies in the late 2000s, in any case.
