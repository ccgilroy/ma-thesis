# Main argument for background

- say what I'm doing in this section overall: providing necessary background on gay neighborhood formation and change
- formation/origins/initial gentrification/time period
- evidence for change is thinner than it seems [present]
    - interview/ethnography
    - media coverage
    - demography/census
- meaning and impact of gay neighborhoods, past and continuing
- broader significance
- what I'm doing here
- end with precise research questions

# Background and significance

[I think Kate still wants this part to be "more general". I don't think there's anything to say at the more abstract level.]

[Ghaziani literally summarizes five classes of explanation for gay neighborhood formation and change in his introduction and footnotes, pp 290-291. what's the point of me rehashing all of this?]

[What the hell do I get out of bringing up the origins of gay neighborhoods, and the analogies to other types of neighborhoods?]

I briefly describe the origins of gay neighborhoods, in order to elaborate on the themes [possibilities] of gentrification and assimilation introduced above. I discuss the existing evidence for change in gay neighborhoods, and assess the degree to which that evidence supports claims of assimilation or gentrification.

How is the status of gay neighborhoods today thought to differ from when they first formed? Have the meaning and impact of gay neighborhoods on LGBTQ lives evolved over time as well?

How much does [SOMETHING] have in common with other urban neighborhoods and other urban change? [that's a big question, can't solve it here]

Finally, I outline my intended contribution to this literature.

## Origins

Gay neighborhoods are urban places with concentrations of gay residents, gay institutions, and gay culture [@levine_gay_1979; @ghaziani_there_2014; @ghaziani_measuring_2014]. They have existed in various American cities since at least the second half of the 20th century [@berube_my_2011; @demilio_capitalism_1992; @ghaziani_there_2014]. They arose to provide safety and visibility for LGBTQ people, and provided a defined space in which to build both a sense of community and political clout [@castells_cultural_1983; @armstrong_forging_2002; @hanhardt_safe_2013; @stewart-winter_queer_2016]. Gay neighborhoods have become a common feature of major cities, an urban type. In the 1970s, only three of the neighborhoods that @levine_gay_1979 investigates across five cities possessed all of the traits necessary to be gay neighborhoods in the sociological sense: the Castro in San Francisco, the West Village in New York, and West Hollywood in Los Angeles. Other neighborhoods, such as New Town in Chicago, possessed only some of these characteristics (people, institutions, culture, and isolation), and were accordingly perceived to be gay neighborhoods in varying degrees. By the 2000s, however, @ghaziani_there_2014 [2] can cite the existence of a dozen neighborhoods across as many cities. Known, visible gay neighborhoods have become established and have proliferated in the past several decades.

**Gay neighborhoods are thought to originate in an initial wave of gentrification.** Working-class neighborhoods with run-down housing stock are renovated by gay newcomers, often with only modest capital [@castells_cultural_1983; @lauria_toward_1985]. This explanation invokes stereotyped traits of gay male aesthetic tastes and the pioneering handiness of lesbians [@ghaziani_there_2014, 231-232]. The "amenities" produced in this way make once-undesirable neighborhoods more generally attractive.

**Gay neighborhoods may therefore decline as a result of advanced gentrification.**

undermine the character or culture, and lead to both the closure of local institutions and the displacement of long-time residents.

exemplars of advanced gentrification [@brown-saracino_explicating_2017]

In this model, gay neighborhoods play a specific intermediate role in urban change.

This stage model implies that
Different gay neighborhoods could exist simultaneously in different stages of "development," even within the same city. In fact, over long periods of time gay neighborhoods do move; "new" and "next" gay neighborhoods emerge in cities like Chicago and New York [@ghaziani_there_2014].

acceptance -> assimilation? [integration]

But are gay neighborhood as urban form bound to a particular historical moment in time, and therefore "passé"?

Rather than only responding to possibly heterogeneous local urban trends, gay neighborhoods may have become more generally "passé" [@brown_gay_2007], because of recent historical changes. In other words, **increasing acceptance might lead to spatial assimilation and cultural integration.** Gay neighborhoods formed in response to stigma. But, since the formation of gay neighborhoods, LGBTQ people in the United States have won social and political victories. Legal achievements include the full decriminalization of homosexuality in 2003, and marriage equality in 2015. Socially, an unusually rapid shift in public opinion has taken place, with majorities now approving of homosexuality and same-sex marriage [@rosenfeld_moving_2017].

These national changes affect the urban places where LGBTQ people live. If one of the defining characteristics of "gay ghettos" was social isolation from mainstream American life [@levine_gay_1979], this isolation could now be coming to an end. For LGBTQ residents of gay neighborhoods, reduced stigma and increasing acceptance may remove the external social forces limiting their residential options. For straight urbanites, as disgust gives way to tolerance or progressiveness, the prospect of living in a gay neighborhood may come to seem attractive rather than outré. The net result of this shift would be a pattern of residential assimilation.

Assimilation and gentrification are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they could be mutually enabling.

In terms of influx:

Gay neighborhoods attract straight residents enticed by urban amenities, some of which exist as a result of initial gay gentrification. But this can occur only if straight people are willing to move into gay neighborhoods.

In terms of outflow:  

A gay neighborhood could simultaneously be losing poorer and more marginalized gay residents to urban gentrification, while also losing more affluent and more integrated gay residents to suburban assimilation.

[in the long run, neighborhoods change. but that's not the question. the question is about recent, rapid change.]

which should be reflected in the economic and demographic profiles of these neighborhoods

## Evidence of change

**Evidence for change in gay neighborhoods is largely restricted to a handful of cities.**

Qualitative work documents changes in bars and street life in both San Francisco and New York [@mattson_style_2014; @hanhardt_safe_2013]. A recent *New York Times* article [@james_there_2017] reiterating the "there goes the gayborhood" [trope, mantra, idea, meme, model] rests primarily on two cases: a *Seattle Times* analysis of Capitol Hill [@balk_map:_2014] and Ghaziani's work on Boystown in Chicago. @ghaziani_there_2014 uses qualitative interviews to document directed LGBTQ migration in Chicago, from Boystown to Andersonville and other queer "cultural archipelagos." While confirming the existence of change, his principle finding does not provide evidence for the assimilation or disappearance of distinct queer urban spaces. In addition to interview data from Chicago, Ghaziani collects media accounts of gay neighborhood change from many cities in the United States. While these accounts establish widespread interest in and concern over change in gay neighborhoods, they do not demonstrate the existence or nature of this change.

The most compelling evidence that gay neighborhood change is widespread comes from two studies examining Atlanta and Dallas. Both are major cities in the South, and fall outside the cities that figure most prominently in journalism and research on gay neighborhood change.

In Midtown, Atlanta, @doan_demise_2011 find

gentrification and affordability of housing

@smart_there_2016

Nevertheless, they say, listings are still centered on the historic gay neighborhood of Oak Lawn.

[final sentence/bridge here]

; since @levine_gay_1979, no single researcher has examined even five cities concurrently. [outside of review articles]

**By contrast, demographic evidence of assimilation is too broad.** Studies of same-sex couples in urban areas do not examine gay neighborhoods specifically. At the metropolitan-area level, demographic research has shown a decline in segregation between same-sex and different-sex couples [@spring_declining_2013]. Unlike the present study, this research does not directly observe the demographics of gay neighborhoods. However, Spring argues that it indirectly implies assimilation in those neighborhoods. She examines 100 metropolitan areas, but she does not claim or demonstrate that all of those places contain gay neighborhoods.

@ghaziani_there_2014 relies extensively on Spring's work to make the argument that gay neighborhood change is widely occurring. He fails to note that his own case, Chicago, is an outlier in her study, with increasing segregation by sexuality for both male same-sex couples and female same-sex couples.

@poston_residential_2017 do not account for gay neighborhoods at all in the formation of their hypotheses. [they say they do, but they don't.]

Without "anchor institutions," even areas with large concentrations of LGBTQ residents are not perceived as gay neighborhoods [@ghaziani_there_2014; @ghaziani_measuring_2014]. These concentrations are invisible. [Why does this matter: bars themselves are good proxies]

## Meaning of gay neighborhoods

**Gay neighborhood change matters because gay neighborhoods remain meaningful to LGBTQ people and continue to materially impact their lives.**

What do gay neighborhoods do? Evidence for the continuing significance of gay neighborhoods.

it remains to be shown whether Grindr is destroying us [it's not, but that's okay]

cultural consequences

material consequences

Gay neighborhoods originated out of a need for "everyday survival" [@castells_cultural_1983] and safety from violence [@hanhardt_safe_2013], then enabled political organization and the formation of social movements [@armstrong_forging_2002]. [MIGHT BE REDUNDANT]

even Ghaziani shows this

LGBTQ are divided on whether or not gay neighborhoods and gay bars are

A national survey of LGBT Americans [@pew_research_center_survey_2013] shows that their opinions are divided on the continuing relevance of gay neighborhoods. A majority, however, do think it is important to maintain spaces like neighborhoods and bars.

[health and wellbeing? do I care? not about health]

refuge, mecca, home

if we take seriously what queer people say is important for their lives, then we must concern ourselves with the fate of gay neighborhoods.

Existing evidence shows that the story is more complicated than pure assimilation.

fragmented "cultural archipelagos" may take the place of monolithic gayborhoods [@ghaziani_there_2014] [just as ephemeral "pop-up" events replace gay bars]

Gay neighborhoods may hold particular importance for young queer and trans people of color. Because of economic barriers, these multiply marginalized individuals already experience these neighborhoods vicariously or transiently, rather than as residents [@hanhardt_safe_2013; @greene_gay_2014].

In the long run, all neighborhoods change. But there is no guarantee that present gay neighborhoods will be replaced, should they disappear.

@ghaziani_there_2014 notes, through interviews and media content analysis, that gay and straight residents of gay neighborhoods cite different reasons for living in them.

## Broader significance

[is this a thing that matters in itself or is it instrumental to something else? am I resistant to taking an instrumental approach to gay neighborhoods (they "just so happen" to be a case of the thing we really care about) because I've seen how that leads people astray---Richard Florida being the most egregious.]

go more general again: because unusual, but also part of urban fabric -> worth exploring

race, ethnicity, and class: "quasi-ethnic" [check Ghaziani's appendix]; hypothesis from racial residential segregation literature [@poston_residential_2017]

a better grasp of what's going on will enable these comparisons

method: more work to be done to connect macro-level Census and media data to micro-level interview and ethnographic data. my work starts to do this.

Why do this? Because these are logically and theoretically connected by the model I laid out above.

despite noted similarities to neighborhoods of immigrants or racial minorities

[obviously not the same as racial redlining]

sexuality possibly less visible

## The approach

theoretically, interested in assimilation and in gentrification

empirically, measure demographic change and economic change at the neighborhood level

**I achieve breadth in two ways**

**First, MORE CITIES**

inspired by classic work, I adopt new Internet-based data [a novel digital data source] which allows me to achieve scale

better establishing the geographic extent of recent gay neighborhood change will

**Second, MORE CHARACTERISTICS**

**If we do not anticipate pure assimilation, it is important to consider broad profiles of demographic and economic change.**

Not structurally equivalent.

**name scope conditions go here, or in the data section?** (lesbians, rurality)
