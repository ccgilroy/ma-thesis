# Main argument

- say what I'm doing in this section overall: providing necessary background on gay neighborhood formation and change
- formation/origins/initial gentrification/time period
- evidence for change is thinner than it seems [present]
    - interview/ethnography
    - media coverage
    - demography/census
- meaning and impact of gay neighborhoods, past and continuing
- broader significance
- what I'm doing here
- end with precise research questions

not sure where these pieces belong yet:

Argument for assimilation

Most arguments for unique change in gay neighborhoods do not assume pure assimilation.

pure assimilation is voluntaristic. Individuals occasionally make this argument, but journalists and researchers tend to acknowledge both assimilation and gentrification as plausible factors in gay neighborhood change. [this is the only model that could entail replacement of gay residents by structurally equivalent straight residents]. Ghaziani calls out this puzzle specifically: it is odd for a neighborhood to simultaneously become more desirable for straight people and less desirable for LGBTQ people [unless, of course, they have different reasons to desire these places, which according to him they do]. frames residence as choice

Argument for gentrification

a form of advanced gentrification specific to gay neighborhoods

# Background and significance

I briefly describe the origins of gay neighborhoods, in order to elaborate on the themes of gentrification and assimilation introduced above. I discuss the existing evidence for change in gay neighborhoods, and assess the degree to which that evidence supports claims of assimilation or gentrification.

How is the status of gay neighborhoods today thought to differ from when they first formed? Have the meaning and impact of gay neighborhoods on LGBTQ lives evolved over time as well?

How much does [SOMETHING] have in common with other urban neighborhoods and other urban change? [that's a big question, can't solve it here]

Finally, I outline my intended contribution to this literature.

## Origins

Gay neighborhoods are urban places with concentrations of gay residents, gay institutions, and gay culture [@levine_gay_1979; @ghaziani_there_2014; @ghaziani_measuring_2014]. They have existed in various US cities since at least the second half of the 20th century [@berube_my_2011; @demilio_capitalism_1992; @ghaziani_there_2014]. They are a common feature of major cities, an urban type. In the 1970s, only three of the 12 neighborhoods that @levine_gay_1979 investigated across five cities possessed all of the traits necessary to be gay neighborhoods in the sociological sense: the Castro in San Francisco, the West Village in New York, and Boys Town (now West Hollywood) in Los Angeles. By the 2000s, @ghaziani_there_2014 [2] could cite the existence of a dozen neighborhoods across as many cities. Known, visible gay neighborhoods have become established and proliferated in the past several decades.

Early sociological work

@levine_gay_1979 demonstrated that the most developed of these neighborhoods followed [what was I going to say here]

**Gay neighborhoods are thought to originate in an initial wave of gentrification.** [Kate thinks this matters. I don't think it's that interesting. Ghaziani cites Zukin to point out that origin and change are different processes.] Working-class neighborhoods with run-down housing stock are renovated by gay newcomers, often with only modest capital [@castells_cultural_1983; @lauria_toward_1985]. This explanation invokes stereotyped traits of gay male aesthetic tastes and the pioneering handiness of lesbians [@ghaziani_there_2014, 231-232]. The "amenities" produced in this way make once-undesirable neighborhoods more generally attractive.

in other words, it's our fault because we went and created ~ amenities ~.

**Gay neighborhoods may decline as a result of advanced gentrification.**

stage model

@collins_sexual_2004

undermine the character or culture, and lead to both the closure of local institutions and the displacement of long-time residents.

@brown-saracino_explicating_2017

exemplars of advanced gentrification [@brown-saracino_explicating_2017]

In this model, gay neighborhoods play a specific intermediate role in urban change. Different gay neighborhoods could exist simultaneously in different stages of "development," even within the same city. In fact, over long periods of time gay neighborhoods do move; "new" and "next" gay neighborhoods emerge in cities like Chicago and New York [@ghaziani_there_2014].

**assimilation goes here**?

if, by contrast, gay neighborhoods have generally become "passé" [@brown_gay_2007]

But are gay neighborhood as urban form bound to a particular historical moment in time, and therefore "passé"?

Post-WWII, then Stonewall and gay liberation

need for community, etc.

Since the formation of gay neighborhoods, LGBTQ people have won social and political victories.

Legal achievements include the full decriminalization of homosexuality in 2003, and marriage equality in 2015. Socially, an unusually rapid shift in public opinion has taken place, with majorities now approving of homosexuality and same-sex marriage [@rosenfeld_moving_2017].

This could bring an end to the "social isolation" characteristic of "gay ghettos" [@levine_gay_1979].

For straight urbanites, as disgust gives way to tolerance or progressiveness, the prospect of living in a gay neighborhood may no longer seem strange.



Legal and social change: marriage equality, public opinion change. removed or undermined the external social forces keeping LGBTQ people together in gay neighborhoods.


isn't quite a contradiction

In fact, assimilation and gentrification are not mutually exclusive. A gay neighborhood could simultaneously be losing poorer and more marginalized gay residents to urban gentrification while also losing more affluent and more integrated gay residents to suburban assimilation. [gay neighborhoods could be leaking at both ends, as it were]

[in the long run, neighborhoods change. but that's not the question. the question is about recent, rapid change.]

## Evidence of change


**Evidence for change in gay neighborhoods is largely restricted to a handful of cities.**

greggor mattson

gene balk

the NYT

In addition to interview data from Chicago, Ghaziani collects media accounts of gay neighborhood change from many cities in the United States. While these accounts establish widespread interest in and concern over change in gay neighborhoods, they do not demonstrate the existence or nature of this change.

The most compelling evidence that gay neighborhood change is widespread comes from two studies examining Atlanta and Dallas.

Nevertheless, they say, listings are still centered on the historic gay neighborhood of Oak Lawn.

[final sentence/bridge here]

**By contrast, demographic evidence of assimilation is too broad.** Studies of same-sex couples in urban areas do not examine gay neighborhoods specifically.

At the metropolitan-area level, demographic research has shown a decline in segregation between same-sex and different-sex couples [@spring_declining_2013]. Unlike the present study, this research does not directly observe the demographics of gay neighborhoods. However, it indirectly implies assimilation in those neighborhoods.

Spring examines 100 metropolitan areas, but she does not demonstrate that all of those areas possess gay neighborhoods.

In relation to Ghaziani's argument, Spring finds that Chicago is a place where segregation increased. [is this ancillary?]

... which would call into question the utility of his case

@poston_residential_2017 do not account for gay neighborhoods at all in the formation of their hypotheses. [they say they do, but they don't.]

Without anchor institutions, even areas with large concentrations of LGBTQ residents are not perceived as gay neighborhoods [@ghaziani_there_2014; @ghaziani_measuring_2014]. These concentrations are invisible. [Why does this matter: bars themselves are good proxies]



## Meaning of gay neighborhoods

**Gay neighborhood change matters because gay neighborhoods remain meaningful to LGBTQ people and continue to materially impact their lives.**

What do gay neighborhoods do? Evidence for the continuing significance of gay neighborhoods.

it remains to be shown whether Grindr is destroying us [it's not, but that's okay]

cultural consequences

material consequences

for "everyday survival" [@castells_cultural_1983] and safety from violence [@hanhardt_safe_2013]

for political organization and the formation of social movements [@armstrong_forging_2002]

even Ghaziani shows this /

LGBTQ are divided on whether or not gay neighborhoods and gay bars are

Pew [queer people think they do SOMETHING]

Pew: queer people are divided, but a majority do think it is important to maintain spaces like neighborhoods and bars.

[health and wellbeing? do I care? not about health]

refuge, mecca, home

if we take seriously what queer people say is important for their lives, then we must concern ourselves with the fate of gay neighborhoods.

Existing evidence shows that the story is more complicated than pure assimilation.

fragmented "cultural archipelagos" may take the place of monolithic gayborhoods [@ghaziani_there_2014] [just as ephemeral "pop-up" events replace gay bars]

Gay neighborhoods may hold particular importance for young queer and trans people of color. Because of economic barriers, these multiply marginalized individuals already experience these neighborhoods vicariously or transiently, rather than as residents [@hanhardt_safe_2013; @greene_gay_2014].

In the long run, all neighborhoods change. But there is no guarantee that present gay neighborhoods will be replaced, should they disappear.


@ghaziani_there_2014 notes, through interviews and media content analysis, that gay and straight residents of gay neighborhoods cite different reasons for living in them.

## Broader significance

[is this a thing that matters in itself or is it instrumental to something else? am I resistant to taking an instrumental approach to gay neighborhoods (they "just so happen" to be a case of the thing we really care about) because I've seen how that leads people astray---Richard Florida being the most egregious.]

go more general again: because unusual, but also part of urban fabric -> worth exploring


method: more work to be done to connect macro-level Census and media data to micro-level interview and ethnographic data. my work starts to do this.

Why do this? Because these are logically and theoretically connected by the model I laid out above.

despite noted similarities to neighborhoods of immigrants or racial minorities

[obviously not the same as racial redlining]

sexuality possibly less visible


## The approach

theoretically, interested in assimilation and in gentrification

empirically, measure demographic change and economic change at the neighborhood level

**I achieve breadth in two ways**

**First, MOAR CITIES**

inspired by classic work, I adopt new Internet-based data [a novel digital data source] which allows me to achieve scale

better establishing the geographic extent of recent gay neighborhood change will

**Second, MOAR CHARACTERISTICS**

**If we do not anticipate pure assimilation, it is important to consider broad profiles of demographic and economic change.**

Not structurally equivalent.



**do scope conditions go here, or in the data section?**
