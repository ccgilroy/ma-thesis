# Discussion and conclusions

It is premature to declare, as the *New York Times* has [@brown_gay_2007; @james_there_2017], that gay neighborhoods are going away. I find that gay neighborhoods were and are demographically and economically distinctive. They share commonalities with each other in what they look like, and in how they change over time. But I find no widespread evidence of assimilation in gay neighborhoods. Instead, I see some evidence of continuing differences. Evidence for a unique degree of advanced gentrification in gay neighborhoods is also limited.

My findings contrast with the "there goes the gayborhood" model. If the amenities and character of gay neighborhoods were uniquely attractive to straight newcomers, we would have seen a marked influx of different-sex married couples, and rents would have likely gone up to match. If LGBTQ people had used their increased acceptance into society to assimilate and integrate, then the integration of gay men would have been reflected in gay neighborhoods becoming less male. I see neither of these trends.

However, gay neighborhoods are not totally static. The moderate increases I observe in education and, to a lesser extent, income levels might eventually undermine status of these places as gay neighborhoods. Paradoxically, the LGBTQ people best positioned to benefit from increasing acceptance---middle-class, white, partnered gay men and lesbians---are also those most able to choose to remain in gay neighborhoods if they desire. Those with the greatest continuing need for LGBTQ spaces---queer youth, trans people, and queer people of color---are the most likely to be pushed out by change. If gay neighborhoods were ever inclusive spaces for the entire LGBTQ community, the risk is that they are now homogenizing, becoming more than ever the exclusive domain of affluent gay men.

My findings are limited in scope to specific material changes, not cultural ones. The cultural and institutional changes that qualitative researchers have observed in gay neighborhoods are real. Bars have closed; the tenor of street life has changed [@hanhardt_safe_2013; @mattson_style_2015]. But I do not see the broad demographic and economic upheaval that is supposed to have precipitated these changes. When gay neighborhoods do change, they differ from other places mostly in terms of symbolic impact. This is why scholars such as @ghaziani_there_2014 have been so attentive to shifts in the meaning of gay neighborhoods. LGBTQ people care about outcomes in these particular neighborhoods not because the processes of urban change are unique, but because their communities are uniquely impacted.


## what concerns remain?

in discussion: acceptance is best for the most CONVENTIONAL gay people. most available to middle class, white...

not for those who are queer, poor, POC, trans, etc.; but the most advantaged had been the economic backbone of the community.

Conversely, gentrification might leave only affluent gay men

again, mention queer POC


even though we see that these neighborhoods


in some senses, I'm doing exactly what Japonica would expect a quant person to do: minimize the findings of qual folks by going more general on them. but that's not exactly it! calling into question straightforward link between demographic/economic change and cultural/institutional change




Cultural and institutional change is real.

I don't see the broad demographic and economic upheaval that is supposed to have precipitated it.

## how connects to general urban stuff?

despite originating in isolation

with more heterosexual Americans expressing support for LGBTQ people than ever before []

What does this tell us more generally? maybe they *haven't* exhausted their purpose, still part of the urban landscape

the fate of the Jewish ghetto was assimilation [through intermarriage]

the gayborhood was supposed to go the same way

but it ain't. so that's cool, I guess?

persistence is kind of intriguing; hopeful? inspiring?

foundation for future comparisons? preserving the uniqueness of gay spaces [is this even a useful model? are the resources LGBTQ communities have by virtue of race and class an unique advantage, one that isn't replicable]

why is change perceived to be more widespread than it is?

## Limitations

The two primary limitations of this work relate to measurement and data. One is impractical to solve; the other may be resolved by future work.

First,


**There are shortcomings to the fact that I cannot measure neighborhood residents' sexualities directly.**

Influx of young, single, male technology workers who are straight would be demographically indistinguishable. except possibly in terms of income. [income mitigates]

In the West Coast cities of San Francisco and Seattle, this "tech bro" demographic is consequential [@herzog_amazon_2015].

does provide a likely alternative explanation to what's happening in the Castro and Polk Street

Second, I am limited by the short time scale of the American Community Survey. "Recent" but maybe too recent

uptick in concern around 2007.

same demographic signature in the past?

**The time scale is an issue.**

Future work should examine change going back to 2000.

There would be little advantage to examining change before 2000, because there is no competing explanation to contend with.

Concern over gay neighborhood change only intensifies in the late 2000s, in any case.

But the stage model [@collins_sexual_2004] is a local model of change

**more clever use of existing measures** to answer who is leaving or being pushed out, and who is moving in. Economic heterogeneity, age structure, etc.

## Future and meta-contributions

Methodologically, itâ€™s productive to complement qualitative findings with broad, comparative, quantitative approaches

Substantively, territoriality is one instantiation of LGBTQ community
How are perceptions of and cultural boundaries around communities shifting?
Given variable attachment among individuals, and rapid social change, how and why are investments in community persisting?

can't look at them only insofar as they are "de-gaying" or "straightening". Think broader!

quantitative thresholds
