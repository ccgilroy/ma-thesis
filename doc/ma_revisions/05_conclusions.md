# Discussion and conclusions

It is premature to declare, as the *New York Times* has [@brown_gay_2007; @james_there_2017], that gay neighborhoods are going away. I find that gay neighborhoods were and are demographically and economically distinctive. They share commonalities with each other in what they look like, and in how they change over time. But I find no widespread evidence of assimilation in gay neighborhoods. Instead, I see some evidence of continuing differences. Evidence for a unique degree of advanced gentrification in gay neighborhoods is also limited.

My findings contrast with the "there goes the gayborhood" model. If the amenities and character of gay neighborhoods were uniquely attractive to straight newcomers, we would have seen a marked influx of different-sex married couples, and rents would have likely gone up to match. If LGBTQ people had used their increased acceptance into society to assimilate and integrate, then the integration of gay men would have been reflected in gay neighborhoods becoming less male. I see neither of these trends.

However, gay neighborhoods are not totally static. The moderate increases I observe in education and, to a lesser extent, income levels might eventually undermine status of these places as gay neighborhoods. Paradoxically, the LGBTQ people best positioned to benefit from increasing acceptance---middle-class, white, partnered gay men and lesbians---are also those most able to choose to remain in gay neighborhoods if they desire. Those with the greatest continuing need for LGBTQ spaces---queer youth, trans people, and queer people of color---are the most likely to be pushed out by change. If gay neighborhoods were ever inclusive spaces for the entire LGBTQ community, the risk is that they are now homogenizing, becoming more than ever the exclusive domain of affluent gay men.

My findings are limited in scope to specific material changes, not cultural ones. The cultural and institutional changes that qualitative researchers have observed in gay neighborhoods are real. Bars have closed; the tenor of street life has changed [@hanhardt_safe_2013; @mattson_style_2015]. But I do not see the broad demographic and economic upheaval that is supposed to have precipitated these changes. Rather than deny the extent of change, as quantitative researchers of gentrification sometimes do [@brown-saracino_explicating_2017], I merely call into question the link between different types of change.
When gay neighborhoods do change, they differ from other places mostly in terms of symbolic impact. This is why scholars such as @ghaziani_there_2014 have been so attentive to shifts in the meaning of gay neighborhoods. LGBTQ people care about outcomes in these particular neighborhoods not because the processes of urban change are unique, but because their communities are uniquely impacted.

Despite their origins in social isolation, gay neighborhoods have persisted. With more heterosexual Americans expressing support for LGBTQ people than ever before [@rosenfeld_moving_2017; @mccarthy_two_2018], this persistence is noteworthy. The fate of Wirth's Jewish ghetto [-@wirth_ghetto_1928] was eventual assimilation, and gay neighborhoods were expected to follow the same path. Instead, they continue to fulfill a role for LGBTQ communities, and to contribute to the fabric of their cities more generally. This finding lays the foundation for future comparisons. Gay spaces may remain distinct through unique advantages, such as economic heterogeneity, or they may hold broader lessons that generalize across marginalized and minority groups. The puzzle of persistence raises intriguing possibilities for future comparative work.

The two primary limitations of the current work relate to measurement and data. One is intrinsically difficult to solve; the other may be addressed by future work. First, there are inevitable shortcomings to the fact that I cannot measure neighborhood residents' sexualities directly. My method relies on straight and LGBTQ residents being demographically distinct from each other. However, young, single individuals---especially men---might be demographically indistinguishable, whether straight or gay. There are specific cases where this has the potential to be a problem. The West Coast cities of San Francisco and Seattle have experienced an influx of young, single, male technology workers, and this straight "tech bro" demographic is consequential for gay neighborhoods in these cities [@herzog_amazon_2015]. In my results, technology workers provide a likely explanation for why the Castro and Polk Street neighborhoods are increasingly single and increasingly male---but possibly still "de-gaying." I mitigate this methodological problem by considering economic factors such as income---"tech bros" are high earners---alongside demographic traits. Fundamentally, however, sexual orientation cannot be measured at fine spatial scales using existing data.

Second, I am limited by the short time scale of the American Community Survey. The uptick in media accounts of gay neighborhood change is recent [@ghaziani_there_2014], as is the surge of research on that change [@brown_gender_2014]. But data beginning in 2006 may be too recent to capture all relevant changes. Moreover, two time points are insufficient to uncover heterogeneity in rates of change across gay neighborhoods, or to account for the possibility that temporal trends are shifted or lagged. Observing heterogeneous or lagged change would provide evidence for the stage model of gayborhoods [@collins_sexual_2004], which explicitly allows for different gay neighborhoods to be in different phases of development or decline. That would, in turn, provide stronger support for the idea that gay neighborhoods change primarily in response to local urban conditions. While I have provided evidence against the competing model of a universal move toward assimilation, positive evidence in favor of heterogeneity would be ideal.

Future work should therefore examine change going back to at least 2000, using the decennial Census. It should be possible to confirm that the gay neighborhoods I observe from 2006 onward had similar demographic signatures in the past. Additional data, over a longer period of time, could confirm patterns of change and help to disentangle the reasons for variations. Using an even wider range of existing measures, such as economic heterogeneity or age structure, could more definitively answer the question of who is leaving or being displaced from gay neighborhoods.



**more clever use of existing measures** to answer who is leaving or being pushed out, and who is moving in. Economic heterogeneity, age structure, etc.

## Future and meta-contributions

Methodologically, itâ€™s productive to complement qualitative findings with broad, comparative, quantitative approaches

Substantively, territoriality is one instantiation of LGBTQ community
How are perceptions of and cultural boundaries around communities shifting?
Given variable attachment among individuals, and rapid social change, how and why are investments in community persisting?

can't look at them only insofar as they are "de-gaying" or "straightening". Think broader!
