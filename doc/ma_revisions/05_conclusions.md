# Discussion and conclusions

## Findings

There goes the gayborhood? No. Of course not.

Gay neighborhoods share distinct commonalities, in what they look like and how they change

No widespread evidence of assimilation, instead some evidence of continuing difference

Mixed evidence of gay-specific advanced gentrification, which might ultimately undermine status of these places as gay neighborhoods


## Limitations


**There are shortcomings to the fact that I cannot measure neighborhood residents' sexualities directly.**

Influx of young, single, male technology workers who are straight would be demographically indistinguishable. except possibly in terms of income.

In the West Coast cities of San Francisco and Seattle, this "tech bro" demographic is consequential [@herzog_amazon_2015].


**The time scale is an issue.**

Future work should examine change going back to 2000.

There would be little advantage to examining change before 2000, because there is no competing explanation to contend with.

Concern over gay neighborhood change only intensifies in the late 2000s, in any case.

**more clever use of existing measures** to answer who is leaving or being pushed out, and who is moving in. Economic heterogeneity, age structure, etc.

## Future and meta-contributions

Methodologically, itâ€™s productive to complement qualitative findings with broad, comparative, quantitative approaches

Substantively, territoriality is one instantiation of LGBTQ community
How are perceptions of and cultural boundaries around communities shifting?
Given variable attachment among individuals, and rapid social change, how and why are investments in community persisting?
