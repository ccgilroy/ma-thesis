## Demarcating gay neighborhoods

Before describing and comparing change over time, I first assess the effectiveness and reliability of my method for locating and demarcating gay neighborhoods. I do this qualitatively and visually, using the two cities of Chicago and Seattle as my principal examples. I choose these cities because both media accounts [@romano_cultures_2015; @james_there_2017; @albright_there_2018] and analyses [@balk_map:_2014; @ghaziani_there_2014] have presented these cases as exemplars of gay neighborhood change. I similarly examine all 28 clusters included in my results below, as well as those excluded, and I discuss common patterns and notable discrepancies here.

@levine_gay_1979 observes that the cultural centers of gay neighborhoods are often one or two named streets. Qualitative and historical research has documented these streets in many cases, and for my method to be successful, it must have included them. Boystown in Chicago is centered on Halsted Street [@ghaziani_there_2014; @stewart-winter_queer_2016]. Capitol Hill in Seattle is centered on the Pike-Pine corridor and Broadway Avenue [@atkins_gay_2011]. My method recovers both of these gay neighborhoods. In these cases, it identifies a recognizable cultural object, centered in a gay culture area with gay institutions.

In Chicago, the largest cluster of gay bars that I observe, covering eight tracts and 18 bars, includes Halsted Street and corresponds to Boystown. It can be seen on the North Side along the shore of Lake Michigan in the map shown in Figure 1. In this figure, I also include a second cluster further to the north, with four tracts and seven bars, that corresponds to the secondary gay neighborhood of Andersonville [@ghaziani_there_2014]. This is the second-largest group of gay bars in Chicago. Bars in the downtown area on the near North Side, in other neighborhoods of the city, and in the suburbs are excluded from further consideration as not belonging to gay neighborhoods.

In Seattle, the largest cluster of gay bars, four tracts and 11 bars, is centered on Pike and Pine Streets and includes parts of Broadway Avenue. This is Capitol Hill, and it is shown in the map in Figure 2. The map shows the overall success of this approach, but also indicates some of its complexities. For instance, the affluent residential areas of North Capitol Hill [@atkins_gay_2011] are not included within my labeled gay neighborhood. At the same time, the boundaries of the Census tracts in the Pike-Pine corridor cross neighborhood borders to include portions of First Hill and the Central District to the south and east.

A bar-based method of identifying gay neighborhoods is better at identifying the general locations of these neighborhoods, rather than their precise boundaries. This is sufficient, because the edges of gay neighborhoods are not clearly and universally specified. That is, gay neighborhoods present a fundamental boundary definition problem [@bowker_sorting_2000]. In other contexts [@hwang_social_2016], the boundaries residents draw of their neighborhoods have been shown to differ systematically among individuals. Census tract borders do not and cannot correspond to these social boundaries; they are a statistical convenience. In any case, gay bars provide a more principled way of delineating the category of gay neighborhoods from other neighborhoods than the primary quantitative alternative, which would be to use the prevalence of same-sex couples [@gates_gay_2004]. Because prevalence is a continuous measure, using it to classify neighborhoods as gay or not gay requires imposing an arbitrary cutoff [@brown_places_2006]. While my approach also involves subjective and pragmatic decisions, it avoids that need.

Examining gay neighborhoods beyond Chicago and Seattle reveals two specific kinds of shortcomings to my method, while confirming its overall validity. In some cases, qualitatively distinct neighborhoods are merged together because they are adjacent to each other. In other cases, the opposite problem occurs, and a single neighborhood is fragmented because its bars are located in noncontiguous tracts.

Neighborhoods are combined in some cities with larger gay neighborhoods. In San Francisco, the Castro, the Mission, and SOMA merge together. The West Village and Chelsea are adjacent in New York, as are Rittenhouse Square and Washington Square in Philadelphia. Dupont Circle, Logan Circle, and Shaw/U Street in Washington, DC, are similarly connected. Qualitative researchers find these differences important. For instance, both @hanhardt_safe_2013 and @greene_gay_2014 distinguish between the three DC neighborhoods, suggesting that they could be expected to undergo different types of change. However, as @compton_beyond_2012 discuss with regard to the Castro and the Mission, drawing precise quantitative boundaries between even well-defined cultural enclaves is difficult. I do not attempt to divide these neighborhoods. Instead, I analyze them as combined units, and run the same models on individual tracts as a robustness check.

Neighborhoods are fragmented in other cities. Capitol Hill in Denver and South Beach in Miami are the two primary instances of this. While the neighborhood labels from GayCities confirm that these are single neighborhoods, I do not attempt to unify them. I use only the largest cluster of bars to stand for the neighborhood as a whole. Maps of the four cities with merged gay neighborhoods and the two cities with fragmented gay neighborhoods are shown in Appendix C.

In total, I identify 28 gay neighborhoods across 23 cities. They are diverse in size and geography. The largest gay neighborhoods by number of tracts and bars are the West Village and Chelsea in New York and the Castro and adjacent areas in San Francisco, which corroborates the historic centrality of these places to gay cultural life. The smallest gay neighborhoods are in Southern cities like San Antonio, Tampa, and Miami, which still exhibit substantial concentrations of gay spaces.

The high degree to which gay institutions are concentrated in gay neighborhoods can be illustrated as follows. Of the 295 Census tracts in these cities that contain at least one gay bar, only 146 tracts---49.5% of the original number---fall in what I consider to be gay neighborhoods. However, these gay neighborhoods contain more than two thirds of all of the gay bars in these cities, numbering 346 of 529, or 67.3%. These 346 gay-neighborhood bars outnumber the 311 gay bars in the 24 other cities and nine resort towns combined. Though I do not produce similar measures of gay residential concentration, I take this uneven distribution to indicate the outsized importance of these neighborhoods for LGBTQ community life.

## Descriptive results

Gay neighborhoods have distinct demographic and economic characteristics, a "signature" of traits not directly related to their residents' sexual identities. For some of these traits, the changes gay neighborhoods have undergone in the past decade are consistent with each other, and distinct from other neighborhoods. On other traits, however, gay neighborhoods exhibit considerable heterogeneity in how they change. I present tables and figures to illustrate these findings, and discuss both general trends and specific examples.

For the 23 cities that are the focus of my analysis, I present average tract values for the seven characteristics of interest in Table 1. I divide Census tracts into four groups: tracts located in gay neighborhoods, tracts matched to be as similar as possible to those neighborhoods in the 2006-2010 time period, tracts containing gay bars outside of gay neighborhoods, and all other tracts in the included counties. I show average values for 2006-2010 and 2011-2015 side-by-side to provide an overview of temporal change.

This is the demographic signature of gay neighborhoods: they are whiter and more educated than most tracts in their areas. They have more men, and fewer married couples. They are denser, wealthier, and more expensive to rent in. This initial description of gay neighborhoods agrees with the work of previous scholars, such as @castells_cultural_1983, @hanhardt_safe_2013, and @ghaziani_there_2014. Table 1 also shows that matching by Mahalanobis distance successfully achieved similarity across all seven variables in 2006-2010. Because gay-neighborhood tracts are unusual, this is important to confirm. Finally, the tracts with gay bars outside gay neighborhoods have different characteristics from those inside gay neighborhoods. These values are often intermediate between gay neighborhoods and other places, except for median income, which is consistently the lowest of all four categories of tracts. This suggests that excluding these tracts from my models is, in fact, appropriate.

Over the short period of time I examine here, the average change seen in gay neighborhoods is not dramatic. Gay neighborhoods hold relatively constant on most demographic characteristics. They become slightly denser, with somewhat higher median rents. The most substantial changes are increases in education levels and incomes. In my models below, I examine how robust these trends are to statistical controls.

Gay neighborhoods differ descriptively from other neighborhoods. To shed light on whether they differ from or are similar to each other, I describe their varying changes in more detail. In the subsequent figures, I present change at the neighborhood level, rather than the tract level. Neighborhoods, again, are aggregates of tracts. This allows me to show the variation across neighborhoods, and to highlight their different trajectories over time.

Figure 3 shows more comprehensively that gay neighborhoods differ demographically from their urban contexts. The four plots compare different demographic characteristics for each neighborhood against the county in which that neighborhood is located. Gay neighborhoods do not only differ on average from other places. Nearly every individual gay neighborhood is more educated, more male, less married, and whiter than its corresponding county. This is consistent with the notion that these neighborhoods are spaces for middle-class, white, gay men. However, the scale of variation differs by variable. Gay neighborhoods cluster narrowly between 50-60% male, which means that they are far from exclusively populated by men. They show much greater heterogeneity in racial composition, from under 25% white in Northcentral, San Antonio, to nearly 90% white in German Village, Columbus. While distinct, gay neighborhoods are not universally white and male.

Figure 3 begins to show change over time, but I use bivariate plots to make the point more clearly.

how much of this changes? Maybe a bit of the interpretation
