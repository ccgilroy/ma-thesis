## Demarcating gay neighborhoods

Before describing and comparing change over time, I first assess the effectiveness and reliability of my method for locating and demarcating gay neighborhoods. I do this qualitatively and visually, using the two cities of Chicago and Seattle as my principal examples. I choose these cities because both media accounts [@romano_cultures_2015; @james_there_2017; @albright_there_2018] and analyses [@balk_map:_2014; @ghaziani_there_2014] have presented these cases as exemplars of gay neighborhood change. I similarly examine all 28 clusters included in my results below, as well as those excluded, and I discuss common patterns and notable discrepancies here.

@levine_gay_1979 observes that the cultural centers of gay neighborhoods are often one or two named streets. Qualitative and historical research has documented these streets in many cases, and for my method to be successful, it must have included them. Boystown in Chicago is centered on Halsted Street [@ghaziani_there_2014; @stewart-winter_queer_2016]. Capitol Hill in Seattle is centered on the Pike-Pine corridor and Broadway Avenue [@atkins_gay_2011]. My method recovers both of these gay neighborhoods. In these cases, it identifies a recognizable cultural object, centered in a gay culture area with gay institutions.

In Chicago, the largest cluster of gay bars that I observe, covering eight tracts and 18 bars, includes Halsted Street and corresponds to Boystown. It can be seen on the North Side along the shore of Lake Michigan in the map shown in Figure 1. In this figure, I also include a second cluster further to the north, with four tracts and seven bars, that corresponds to the secondary gay neighborhood of Andersonville [@ghaziani_there_2014]. This is the second-largest group of gay bars in Chicago. Bars in the downtown area on the near North Side, in other neighborhoods of the city, and in the suburbs are excluded from further consideration as not belonging to gay neighborhoods.

In Seattle, the largest cluster of gay bars, four tracts and 11 bars, is centered on Pike and Pine Streets and includes parts of Broadway Avenue. This is Capitol Hill, and it is shown in the map in Figure 2. The map shows the overall success of this approach, but also indicates some of its complexities. For instance, the affluent residential areas of North Capitol Hill [@atkins_gay_2011] are not included within my labeled gay neighborhood. At the same time, the boundaries of the Census tracts in the Pike-Pine corridor cross neighborhood borders to include portions of First Hill and the Central District to the south and east.

A bar-based method of identifying gay neighborhoods is better at identifying the general locations of these neighborhoods, rather than their precise boundaries. This is sufficient, because the edges of gay neighborhoods are not clearly and universally specified. That is, gay neighborhoods present a fundamental boundary definition problem [@bowker_sorting_2000]. In other contexts [@hwang_social_2016], the boundaries residents draw of their neighborhoods have been shown to differ systematically among individuals. Census tract borders do not and cannot correspond to these social boundaries; they are a statistical convenience. In any case, gay bars provide a more principled way of delineating the category of gay neighborhoods from other neighborhoods than the primary quantitative alternative, which would be to use the prevalence of same-sex couples [@gates_gay_2004]. Because prevalence is a continuous measure, using it to classify neighborhoods as gay or not gay requires imposing an arbitrary cutoff [@brown_places_2006]. While my approach also involves subjective and pragmatic decisions, it avoids that need.




qualitative researchers find these differences important, but I do not account for them.

For instance, WASHINGTON DC

the best attempt to do this,

bounding the Castro and the Mission in SF,

acknowledges how difficult it is.

qualitatively discuss some shortcomings

adjacent neighborhoods could have different dynamics

spaces versus populations

again, I think if we care about the people, we have to care about the places

two specific kinds of problems: agglomeration of adjacent neighborhoods that should be distinct and fragmentation of single neighborhoods that should be merged

qualitatively and visually assess all 28 clusters included, as well as those excluded

## Descriptive results

demographic signature; distinct change on SOME characteristics, but not others

## Modeling results

how much of this changes? Maybe a bit of the interpretation
