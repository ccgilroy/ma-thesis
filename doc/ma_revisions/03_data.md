[is this data? or is it methods? should I combine them?]

## Gay bars

**I use clusters of gay bars to demarcate gay neighborhoods, because concentrations of gay institutions are part of the definition of gay neighborhoods.**

**Not all clusters of gay bars are gay neighborhoods, so I use other aspects of the definition to further filter my neighborhoods.**

*residential concentration* -> filter out warehouse districts

*set the tone, cultural dominance* -> filter out downtowns

**I am not concerned about selectivity in the GayCities data.** Any archival source is bound to be selective.

an invisible gay neighborhood is not a gay neighborhood

**Because I am examining the present outcomes of past gay neighborhoods, my indicator of gay neighborhoods should be historical.** I can access an archived version of GayCities from 2007, and I use this instead of the present version of the website.


Single bars may open and close, but clusters of bars do not spring up overnight.

**Digital data enable analysis at scale.**

this is *why* I can do more than five cities.

; I did not have to choose in advance which cities to digitize---I had 48 to examine.


**something about geolocation**

**I merge adjacent tracts in the final analysis for substantive and methodological reasons.**

Census tracts are not neighborhoods

## Change and matching



**matched tracts are not contiguous**, unlike gay neighborhood tracts
