# Introduction

- start more generally [I'll need help with this]
- then introduce the specific case
    - perceived problem
    - model of change
    - possible alternative [make this clear early on]
    - why this matters [THE STAKES]
    - history of gay neighborhoods
    - what I'm doing that's new

[not sure where the divide between intro and background/significance is. First is kind of high-level, the second gets more into specific questions]

what's the relationship between studying places and studying people? which do we care about?

The predictions of pure assimilation and pure economic change are at odds.

who are these spaces most meaningful for? what can we expect that to mean for who leaves and who doesn't?

NOT by studying the displaced, but by studying influx and change that COULD lead to displacement

[this is why discussion of gentrification should be relegated to the end]

not evidence for pure assimilation.

paradoxical: the initial wave of gentrification that creates a gay neighborhood serves to make it a more desirable target for later waves of gentrification

[on large time scales, neighborhoods change, shift, move. gay neighborhoods---northward shifts in Chicago and New York]

the only way it makes sense for us not to see demographic/economic change across other characteristics is in the pure-assimilation case.

# Background

# Data and Methods

hew closely to Kate's suggestions. main points first, then caveats.

# Results

if I've captured a signature of gay neighborhoods, what's fundamental? what's an ancillary piece of that signature

- there should be LGBTQ people
- male is because skewed towards gay men as opposed to queer women
- white, well-educated

think more about descriptives

# Discussion

return to terms like "assimilation" and "gentrification"

what are the economic signatures of "ghetto"-style urban organization?

LGBTQ people are heterogeneous in terms of race and class. How is, or isn't, this reflected in gay neighborhoods? (Shown here to be, on average, whiter and wealthier than other parts of their cities)

go back longer time scale

while the oldest extant gay neighborhoods go back to at least the 1970s (Castro, West Village), even other well-established gay neighborhoods are more recent (Capitol Hill, Boystown)


part of the struggle to establish sexuality as a structuring social force, alongside gender, race, class, including in terms of its impact on the structure of urban space

[again, we DON'T expect it to do the same things as race, class, gender]
